# Dr. David Sinclair’s Health & Longevity Recommendations

David A. Sinclair, Ph.D., is a Harvard genetics professor and a prominent voice in longevity science. Through his research, books, podcasts, and interviews, Sinclair has shared a comprehensive set of lifestyle and therapeutic recommendations aimed at extending healthspan and lifespan. This report compiles **Sinclair’s own advice** on longevity, organized by theme, with direct citations to his statements. The overarching message is optimistic: aging is malleable and can be slowed, halted, or even reversed by engaging the body’s natural defense pathways. Sinclair practices what he preaches – often using himself (and even family members) as “guinea pigs” – and emphasizes evidence-backed interventions alongside emerging therapies. 

Below, we detail Sinclair’s guidance on longevity fundamentals, diet and fasting, supplements, exercise, mental well-being, tracking biomarkers, hormesis (stress adaptation), environment, epigenetics, and future aging therapies. Each section distills Sinclair’s key points and the rationale behind them, in clear terms, with his own words and published insights to support each recommendation.

## Longevity and Anti-Aging Foundations

Sinclair reframes aging as a condition that **can be targeted and treated**, not an inexorable fact of life. He often states that “aging is a loss of information” at the cellular level – specifically a degradation of the epigenetic “software” that tells our cells which genes to read. This loss of cellular instructions leads to the hallmark signs of aging: cells malfunctioning, tissues failing, and the body’s repair systems faltering ([Q&A: How David Sinclair is Fighting Aging—and How You Can, Too](https://blog.insidetracker.com/david-sinclair-fighting-aging-lifespan#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAs%20a%20scientific%20definition%2C%20I%27m,%E2%80%9D)). Crucially, Sinclair argues there is *no law of biology* that says aging must happen the way it does. In fact, he notes that some mammals live over 200 years, so humans likely have untapped longevity potential beyond the typical 80-year lifespan ([Q&A: How David Sinclair is Fighting Aging—and How You Can, Too](https://blog.insidetracker.com/david-sinclair-fighting-aging-lifespan#:~:text=David%3A%20%E2%80%9CWell%2C%20we%27re%20biological%2C%20and,%E2%80%9D)). In his words, “there’s no law of physics that says we can’t live a lot longer” – potentially much longer – if we can preserve or restore the information that keeps cells youthful (Sinclair, 2019). 

**Aging as a Treatable Disease:** Sinclair advocates classifying aging itself as a disease. By the current medical definition, a disease is a condition that leads to functional decline; by that logic, aging qualifies, except that it happens to more than 50% of people ([Q&A: How David Sinclair is Fighting Aging—and How You Can, Too](https://blog.insidetracker.com/david-sinclair-fighting-aging-lifespan#:~:text=That%20isn%E2%80%99t%20how%20aging%20is,a%20regulatory%20perspective%20though%2C%20right)). Sinclair finds it irrational that we *accept* ailments like memory loss, frailty, and organ failure just because “it happens to everyone.” Instead, he urges we view aging as *pathological* and fight it: *“we no longer accept that it’s okay to go blind and deaf and to lose our memory at any age”*, he says, so we should likewise not accept the diseases of aging as “natural” or inevitable ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=DAS%3A%20One%20reason%20is%20the,what%20everyone%20else%20is%20accepting)). This conceptual shift has ethical and social implications (e.g. planning for longer lives), but Sinclair believes it’s critical for mobilizing research and public support to *target aging itself* rather than only treating individual age-related diseases.

**The Information Theory of Aging:** In his book *Lifespan*, Sinclair proposes that aging is caused by the loss of epigenetic information – akin to scratches on a DVD that prevent cells from reading the correct “tracks” of DNA ([David Sinclair Explains How Reversing Aging Is Possible: Neil deGrasse Tyson Interview ](https://www.nad.com/news/david-sinclair-explains-how-reversing-aging-is-possible-neil-degrasse-tyson-interview#:~:text=Genetic%20information%20is%20like%20hardware%2C,can%20activate%20to%20reverse%20aging)) ([David Sinclair Explains How Reversing Aging Is Possible: Neil deGrasse Tyson Interview ](https://www.nad.com/news/david-sinclair-explains-how-reversing-aging-is-possible-neil-degrasse-tyson-interview#:~:text=,Unbundling%20DNA%20turns%20genes%20on)). Over time, due to stresses and DNA damage, cells “forget” their identity. However, Sinclair’s optimism comes from evidence that this process *can be reversed*. He explains that there appears to be a backup copy of the epigenetic software in cells: *“aging is like the software glitches; we’ve found there’s a backup disk and we can restore the software”* (Sinclair, 2024). In experiments from his lab, old cells and even entire organisms have been made physiologically younger by resetting epigenetic marks. For example, using certain genes (the Yamanaka factors) to reboot cells, his team restored vision in old mice and even extended mouse lifespan ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=DAS%3A%20The%20information%20theory%20of,to%20reinstall%20the%20software%20itself)) ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=Advertisement)). This groundbreaking work suggests that *“aging is reversible in many tissues and organs, and even in the whole animal”* ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=wasn%E2%80%99t%20too%20long%20ago%20when,even%20in%20the%20whole%20animal)). Sinclair frequently shares these results to underscore that aging should no longer be seen as a one-way street – if damage can be reversed in animals, similar therapies may eventually rejuvenate humans.

**Longevity Genes and Survival Circuit:** Sinclair’s approach to extending healthy life hinges on activating ancient *“longevity genes.”* These include the sirtuins (SIRT1-7), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and mTOR pathways. Collectively, they form what he calls an adversity or **survival circuit** – switched on by biological stress to protect and repair the body ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=,such%20as%20fasting%20and%20exercising)) ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=,to%20control%20the%20aging%20process)). This concept arose from decades of research (pioneered by figures like Cynthia Kenyon and Leonard Guarente) showing that organisms from yeast to mammals have built-in mechanisms to boost survival under hardship ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=Biological%20Adversity%20and%20the%20Survival,9m32s)). Sinclair notes that in the 1990s, scientists discovered mutations that extended worm lifespans (e.g. **DAF-2** in Kenyon’s work), revealing that aging is controlled by genes, not just wear-and-tear. In Sinclair’s words, these longevity genes *“are activated by adversity”* and induce a preservation mode – cells hunker down, repair DNA, recycle waste, and sustain life until conditions improve (Sinclair, 2022). 

From an evolutionary perspective, when food is scarce or when we exercise, our bodies think times are tough and **shift resources from growth to maintenance**. Sinclair’s foundational advice is to trick our bodies into activating these defenses regularly. *“The trick is to induce a state of perceived adversity,”* he explains ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)) – essentially, to make the body *think* it needs to fight to survive (through practices like fasting, intense exercise, temperature stress, etc., which we detail later). By doing so, we keep those longevity pathways (sirtuins, AMPK, etc.) engaged day to day, which in turn can slow aging and reduce diseases. 

Importantly, Sinclair emphasizes **lifestyle first**. While he is at the forefront of biotech (working on age-reversal genes and molecules), he often reminds that simple habits yield powerful effects. *“Lifestyle changes should be done first and foremost,”* he says, before considering any experimental drug ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=it%20looks%20very%20promising%2C%20and,myself%20as%20a%20guinea%20pig)) ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=But%20I%20don%E2%80%99t%20recommend%20it,be%20done%20first%20and%20foremost)). In fact, Sinclair himself, despite having access to cutting-edge interventions, attributes his own biological youth largely to daily habits: eating right, exercising, and avoiding harmful behaviors. As he told one interviewer, his routine got him the biomarkers of someone much younger – he has the “heart of a 20-year-old” and an epigenetic age significantly below his chronological age (Sinclair, 2023). This dramatic difference, he insists, came from consistent application of the very advice outlined in the sections below.

To summarize Sinclair’s foundational view:

- **Aging is not inevitable** – it’s driven by reversible processes. We should approach it like a disease we can prevent and treat (Sinclair, 2019).
- **Activate your longevity genes** – through lifestyle “stressors” that engage the body’s repair programs.
- **Don’t wait until old age** – aging begins early (even from conception), so the sooner one adopts healthy habits, the greater the impact on lifetime aging rate ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=DAS%3A%2020%20years%20ago%2C%20we,aging%2C%20including%20at%20college%20age)).
- **Stay informed and optimistic** – Sinclair often shares that the public underestimates how close science is to real age-reversal therapies. He believes the coming decades will transform medicine with treatments that reset our biological age (possibly including a “$10 pill” that mimics age-resetting effects in every cell ([David Sinclair Explains How Reversing Aging Is Possible: Neil deGrasse Tyson Interview ](https://www.nad.com/news/david-sinclair-explains-how-reversing-aging-is-possible-neil-degrasse-tyson-interview#:~:text=,next%20five%20to%20six%20years)) ([David Sinclair Explains How Reversing Aging Is Possible: Neil deGrasse Tyson Interview ](https://www.nad.com/news/david-sinclair-explains-how-reversing-aging-is-possible-neil-degrasse-tyson-interview#:~:text=young%20again.%20,next%20five%20to%20six%20years))). But until then, there is *a lot* one can do personally.

In the following sections, we delve into those personal strategies – what Sinclair actually eats and drinks, what supplements he takes, how he exercises, and how he integrates emerging science into daily life to slow aging. All recommendations are **directly from Dr. Sinclair** – pulled from his book, *Lifespan*, his 2022 *Lifespan* podcast series, and interviews through 2025 – providing a detailed picture of his longevity protocol.

## Diet, Caloric Restriction, and Fasting

One of Sinclair’s core principles for longevity is **eating less often**. He preaches and practices some form of caloric restriction or intermittent fasting as “the easiest way to induce your body’s survival mechanisms” (Sinclair, 2022). In his own routine, this translates to skipping at least one meal per day – usually breakfast (and often lunch too) – to compress his eating window. *“I try to skip one meal a day or at least make it really small,”* he has said, noting that his busy schedule “almost always means that I miss lunch most days of the week” (Sinclair, 2019) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20often%20eats%20only,%E2%80%9D)). By extending the daily fasting period, Sinclair keeps his blood sugar and insulin low for most of the day, which in turn keeps longevity genes like sirtuins and AMPK activated ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1032%20Remember%2C%20particularly,You%20won%E2%80%99t%20get)) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=Remember%2C%20particularly%20AMPK%20and%20the,You%20won%E2%80%99t%20get)).

**Intermittent Fasting (Time-Restricted Eating):** Sinclair typically follows a **16:8 or longer fasting regimen**, often going all day without food until a big evening meal. *“Time-restricted feeding, which is what I do… I try not to eat till dinner,”* he says ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=turning%20on%20that%20autophagy%2C%20that,at%20going%20beyond%2024%20hours)) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)). This approach might equate to one meal a day (OMAD) or occasionally two small meals in a short window. He admits it was challenging at first (*“it’s hard enough… I’m more of a hedonist”* he jokes about his love of food ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=Yeah%2C%20time,of%20a%20hedonist%2C%20but%20he))), but with persistence he adapted and lost excess weight. In fact, Sinclair has shared that once he found tricks to manage hunger (like drinking coffee/tea and eating a few nuts during the day), he *“got [his] 20-year-old body back for the first time”* in years ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=match%20at%20L946%20me%20is,first%20time%20in%20my%20life)) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=me%20is%20I%E2%80%99ve%20trained%20my,first%20time%20in%20my%20life)). The key, he notes, is consistency: compressing daily caloric intake trains the body to spend more time in a *fasted* state, which triggers autophagy (cellular cleanup) and keeps metabolism efficient.

Some practical fasting tips from Sinclair: *“Fill your body with fluids”* during the fasting period – black coffee, green or black tea, and lots of water ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=And%20that%20trick%2C%20I%E2%80%99m%20not,the%20feeling%20of%20hunger%20rapidly)) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=)). The caffeine and hydration blunt hunger and also have beneficial polyphenols. If extremely hungry, he suggests a small handful of nuts or a piece of very dark chocolate to stave off cravings without spiking blood sugar ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=And%20that%20trick%2C%20I%E2%80%99m%20not,the%20feeling%20of%20hunger%20rapidly)) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=the%20way%20through%20the%20day%2C,the%20feeling%20of%20hunger%20rapidly)). Protein-rich nuts in particular can quickly sate appetite by influencing hunger hormones. By using these strategies, Sinclair says he was finally able to adhere to a daily fasting routine after *“years [of failing] to get rid of my love handles”* when simply cutting calories without timing (Sinclair, 2022).

**Periodic Longer Fasts:** In addition to daily time-restricted eating, Sinclair acknowledges the value of occasional multi-day fasting, though he personally doesn’t often do fasts beyond 24 hours. In his podcast, he describes three tiers of fasting: (1) Intermittent daily fasting (skipping meals), (2) **Extended fasts** of 2–7 days, and (3) **Fasting-mimicking diets (FMD)** which provide minimal calories. Sinclair says even just **3 days of fasting** can trigger a “deep cleanse” – after ~48–72 hours, the body enters a state of **chaperone-mediated autophagy**, a intensive recycling mode for cellular components ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=The%20next%20one%20let%E2%80%99s%20talk,is%20what%20I%20do%2C%20because)). Longer fasts (5–7 days) should be done infrequently (he warns not to go much beyond a week to avoid muscle loss ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=We%E2%80%99ll%20just%20call%20it%20fasting,is%20what%20I%20do%2C%20because))), but they can rejuvenate the immune system and reduce inflammation. 

For those unable or unwilling to do water-only fasts, Sinclair highlights the FMD developed by his colleague Dr. Valter Longo. *“There’s a fasting-mimicking diet… Valter Longo… is a proponent of that. It’s a diet that lowers mTOR activity; it’s low in these branched-chain amino acids,”* Sinclair explains ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=Yeah%2C%20well%2C%20this%20is%20why,amino%20acids%20that%20I%E2%80%99ve%20mentioned)) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=so%20there%E2%80%99s%20a%20fasting,amino%20acids%20that%20I%E2%80%99ve%20mentioned)). The FMD involves eating a very low-calorie, low-protein plant-based diet for five days, which “mimics” a fast in the body. Sinclair notes Longo’s research showing this diet, done a few times a year, can have significant benefits – from improved chemotherapy tolerance in cancer patients to markers of reduced aging ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=Yeah%2C%20you%20want%20the%20body,So%20that%E2%80%99s%20one)) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=of%20these%20amino%20acids,So%20that%E2%80%99s%20one)). **He suggests that doing a 5-day FMD periodically (e.g. several times annually) may yield many of the advantages of a water fast** (Longo et al., 2018). Sinclair himself sometimes utilizes commercially available FMD kits (like ProLon) and finds that *“the food itself will mimic [a fast]”* without complete starvation ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=Okay%2C%20and%20is%20that%20a,not%20taking%20in%20any%20calories)) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20both%2C%20but%20you%20don%E2%80%99t,food%20itself%20will%20mimic%20it)). In short, whether via intermittent daily fasting or periodic prolonged fasts, *reducing overall feeding frequency* is central to Sinclair’s regimen.

**Plant-Based, Low-Sugar Diet:** When Sinclair does eat, his focus is on **plant foods, minimal sugars, and moderate protein**. *“Eat less, start working toward fasting, cut the sugar, cut the meat, eat the veggies,”* he summarizes as the basic dietary pattern ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1524%20Okay%2C%20so,are%20enjoying%20a%20little%20xenohormatic)) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=Okay%2C%20so%20eat%20less%2C%20start,are%20enjoying%20a%20little%20xenohormatic)). Some specifics:

- **Cut Sugar and Refined Carbs:** Sinclair is emphatic that *“the big killer is sugar. Glucose – particularly fructose – is pernicious,”* contributing to fatty liver, diabetes, and aging ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1003%20Right%2C%20well%2C,It%E2%80%99s%20really%20bad)) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=Right%2C%20well%2C%20the%20big%20killer,It%E2%80%99s%20really%20bad)). He cites studies in simple organisms and humans that high glucose shortens lifespan, whereas glucose restriction extends it ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=reduce%20the%20amount%20of%20sugar,That%20you%20can%2C%20just%20by)). Mechanistically, constant high blood sugar keeps the longevity enzymes (AMPK, sirtuins) *switched off*, preventing the body’s defenses from activating ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1032%20Remember%2C%20particularly,You%20won%E2%80%99t%20get)). Sinclair’s advice is to **minimize sugar and high-glycemic starch** in the diet: *“avoid sugary drinks and foods… keep glucose levels low and consistent”* throughout the day ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1439%20Yeah%2C%20and,avoid%20sugary%20drinks%20and%20foods)) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=Remember%2C%20particularly%20AMPK%20and%20the,You%20won%E2%80%99t%20get)). For example, Sinclair avoids sweet desserts and even high-sugar fruits. If one does indulge, he suggests **having sugar at the end of a meal, not on an empty stomach**, to blunt the glucose spike: *“Dessert is fine, but put it at the end. Don’t start with sugar”* (Sinclair, 2022) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=carbohydrates%2C%20eat%20the%20veggies,are%20enjoying%20a%20little%20xenohormatic)). By front-loading meals with fiber, protein, and fat, one can slow sugar absorption. 

- **Mostly Plants, Very Little Meat:** Sinclair follows a largely **plant-based diet**. *“I eat a lot of plants and try to avoid eating other mammals,”* he says, partly for health and partly ethical reasons ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=Dr,tea%20and%20very%20little%20alcohol)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20eats%20little%20to,%E2%80%9D)). He notes that plant foods tend to be lower in branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) like leucine, which activate mTOR – a growth pathway that, when chronically active, can accelerate aging. By contrast, a plant-heavy diet with fewer amino acids creates a mild nutrient stress that may promote longevity (similar to fasting) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=more)). Sinclair’s daily diet is rich in vegetables, especially greens and those with high phytonutrient content. He also consumes nuts, legumes, and some whole grains, aiming for high fiber and lots of micronutrients. These plant foods often contain what he calls **xenohormetic molecules** – compounds produced by plants under stress (like resveratrol in grapes or EGCG in tea) that can activate our own stress-resistance pathways when we ingest them. He encourages choosing vegetables and fruits that had to “struggle” (for example, organic produce, or colorful produce with defensive chemicals) as they may have more of these beneficial polyphenols ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=Okay%2C%20so%20eat%20less%2C%20start,are%20enjoying%20a%20little%20xenohormatic)) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=carbohydrates%2C%20eat%20the%20veggies,are%20enjoying%20a%20little%20xenohormatic)).

- **Protein and Animal Foods:** While Sinclair does **restrict animal protein**, he does not advocate zero protein or veganism at all times. In fact, he warns against going *too* low in protein such that one becomes frail or malnourished – balance is key. *“You don’t want to be too low in anything. You don’t want to be hangry,”* he jokes, noting that even lab animals on low protein can become aggressive ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)). His strategy is to generally keep protein intake moderate and mostly plant-sourced, *except* around strength-training workouts where he allows more protein (and occasionally meat) to support muscle. *“If I work out, I will eat meat,”* Sinclair says ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=Dr,tea%20and%20very%20little%20alcohol)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20eats%20little%20to,%E2%80%9D)), indicating that after intense exercise he sometimes consumes a serving of animal protein to aid recovery. This might be fish or a piece of chicken; he avoids red meat for the most part, although in one interview he mentioned enjoying a steak with his father on rare occasion (Sinclair, 2020). Overall, by timing higher protein meals around workouts and eating plant-based otherwise, he aims to get the benefits of muscle maintenance without chronically elevating growth pathways.

- **Healthy Fats and Other Foods:** Sinclair’s diet includes healthy fats like olive oil. He often mixes his morning yogurt with nuts and berries (when he takes his resveratrol supplement, discussed later), emphasizing unsweetened Greek yogurt or plant yogurt as a small breakfast if any. He avoids fried foods and excessive saturated fat. **Alcohol is minimized** – *“I rarely drink alcohol these days because it’s a neurotoxin… it’s thought to shrink the brain,”* he says bluntly ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=a%20happier%20life%20as%20well)) ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=I%20would%20drink%20a%20lot,to%20be%20in%20good%20condition)). Sinclair will occasionally have a glass of red wine (which contains resveratrol) but cautions that even one drink a day can have negative health effects; he personally has dramatically cut back on alcohol in pursuit of longevity.

**Stable Blood Sugar and “Biohacking” Diet:** Sinclair measures his response to foods using a **continuous glucose monitor (CGM)** on his arm ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=3)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=Professor%20Sinclair%20uses%20a%20continuous,increase%20his%20blood%20sugar%20levels)). This lets him see in real time which foods spike his blood sugar. He discovered, for example, that white rice and grapes cause a big glucose spike for him, whereas potatoes do not ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=foods%20impact%20my%20blood%20sugar,term%20health)). Using such data, he fine-tunes his diet to avoid glucose swings. *“Having stable blood glucose is really important, not only for daily energy but also for long-term health,”* Sinclair notes ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=foods%20impact%20my%20blood%20sugar,term%20health)) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=discussed%20on%20this%20podcast%2C%20having,term%20health)). High glycemic variability is linked to inflammation and aging, so he aims to keep his post-meal blood sugar rise modest (generally under 110 mg/dL). Tactics include: eating high-fiber vegetables first, adding vinegar to meals, walking after meals (even just 10-15 minutes) to dispose of glucose, and as mentioned, reserving sugary treats for after a main meal. In effect, Sinclair treats diet like a science experiment – he tracks, measures, and adjusts continuously.

In summary, **Sinclair’s dietary recommendations** for longevity are: 

- **Eat less frequently** – Compress daily eating window (16+ hours fasting). *“Eat less often. When you do eat, kill the sugar”* (Sinclair, 2022) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=Yeah%2C%20and%20don%E2%80%99t%20snack,avoid%20sugary%20drinks%20and%20foods)) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1443%20Okay%2C%20eat,do%20eat%2C%20kill%20the%20sugar)).
- **Adopt fasting habits** – Consider occasional multi-day fasts or fasting-mimicking diets to deeply engage repair processes.
- **Avoid sugars and refined carbs** – These deactivate longevity pathways and drive aging. Keep blood glucose low and stable ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1032%20Remember%2C%20particularly,You%20won%E2%80%99t%20get)) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=Remember%2C%20particularly%20AMPK%20and%20the,You%20won%E2%80%99t%20get)).
- **Favor plant-based foods** – High in nutrients and xenohormetics, low in amino acids that accelerate aging. Lots of vegetables, legumes, nuts.
- **Limit animal proteins, especially red meat** – Too much animal protein (rich in leucine and methionine) can speed aging. If you consume meat, use it strategically (e.g. around workouts) and in moderation ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=Dr,tea%20and%20very%20little%20alcohol)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20eats%20little%20to,%E2%80%9D)).
- **Stay slightly hungry (but not malnourished)** – Aim for a nutritional state that signals scarcity. As Sinclair puts it, *“being on the edge of hungry”* is where your body’s defenses are activated, as long as you’re getting sufficient micronutrients (Sinclair, 2019).
- **Hydrate and consume polyphenols** – Drink green tea (Sinclair drinks several cups daily), black coffee, and plenty of water. Tea and coffee not only blunt appetite but also contain compounds (EGCG, caffeine) that may enhance metabolic health and AMPK activation. He adds a squeeze of lemon to water sometimes for polyphenols and because he enjoys the taste.
- **Minimal alcohol** – If longevity is the goal, Sinclair advises cutting alcohol to a minimum, due to its links with cancer and brain aging. He notes that populations known for longevity (like centenarians) often drink only sparingly or not at all.
- **Personalize your diet** – Track your biomarkers (glucose, cholesterol, etc.) and see how diet changes affect them. Sinclair uses devices and blood tests to guide his diet, and encourages others to find what keeps their metrics in the optimal range (more on tracking later).

By adhering to this pattern – **fasting, low sugar, plant-forward eating** – Sinclair believes one can greatly lower their risk of age-related diseases. He often cites his 80+ year-old father as an example: after adopting these dietary practices in his late 70s, Sinclair’s father lost weight, gained energy, and even *“became physically younger”* by measurable metrics, now running and enjoying life more than he did a decade prior (Sinclair, 2020). Diet is a powerful lever, and as Sinclair quips, *“if I was in college and knew what I know now, I would eat a lot fewer pizzas”* and more salads ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=If%20I%20was%20in%20college%2C,also%20would%20get%20better%20sleep)).

## Supplementation and Longevity Molecules

Dr. Sinclair is well-known for his personal supplement stack – a combination of molecules aimed at supporting the longevity pathways we discussed. He often prefaces that supplements are *not* a magic bullet and should complement, not replace, healthy living. Nonetheless, he has carefully chosen a set of compounds based on lab evidence and his own research. Here we detail Sinclair’s supplement regimen, including dosages he’s mentioned, and the rationale behind each:

- **Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN):** This is perhaps Sinclair’s most famous supplement. NMN is a precursor to NAD⁺, a vital coenzyme that sirtuins and other longevity enzymes require to function. Our NAD⁺ levels decline with age, so boosting NAD⁺ is thought to mimic the effects of diet and exercise on a cellular level. Sinclair’s lab found that raising NAD⁺ in mice rejuvenated aspects of their biology. As a result, **he takes 1 gram of NMN every morning** on an empty stomach ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1679%20Yeah%2C%20I,grams%20and%20triple%20the%20amount)) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)). Human studies have shown 250–1000 mg of NMN can increase NAD⁺ in cells, and Sinclair opts for the higher end, noting that in people his age (~50s) that dose roughly doubles NAD⁺ levels ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=Yeah%2C%20I%20take%20one%20gram,grams%20and%20triple%20the%20amount)). He has said one could take up to 2 grams, which might even triple NAD, but he sticks with 1 g for long-term use ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)). 

  *Timing:* Sinclair takes NMN in the **morning** (usually along with or before breakfast). *“I take these in the morning because that’s when the natural rise in NAD and SIRT1 activity should happen,”* he notes ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1686%20It%E2%80%99s%20important,hour%20clock.%20SIRT1%20regulates)) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20important%20to%20mention%20that,BMAL%20pathway)). Our bodies have a circadian rhythm for NAD⁺ – levels tend to peak in the early day – so he aligns supplementation accordingly. He believes this also helps with jet lag and energy alignment, reporting that NMN **helps prevent jet lag** by resetting his body clock when traveling ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=rise%20in%20NAD%20and%20SIRT1,BMAL%20pathway)) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=a%20protein%20called%20BMAL%20that,BMAL%20pathway)).

  *Why NMN (and not NR):* Another NAD precursor, **nicotinamide riboside (NR)**, is on the market and often compared to NMN. Sinclair has stated he prefers NMN because animal studies showed NR was less effective at extending lifespan (in fact, some mouse studies saw no lifespan extension from NR) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20interesting%20to%20know%20that,to%20be%20superior%20to%20NR)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=1%2C000%20mg%20is%20a%20high,R%2CR)). NMN, on the other hand, has more promising data and his own research experience behind it. He also mentions that NR has to be converted into NMN in the body to be useful, so he takes the “direct route” with NMN (Sinclair, 2022). For those who cannot get NMN (which as of late 2022 became harder to obtain in the US due to regulatory changes), Sinclair suggests taking **vitamin B3 (niacin) or niacinamide** as a modest NAD booster, or trying **NR** – but in his opinion, NMN is the superior choice for now. 

- **Resveratrol:** This is a polyphenol derived from grape skin and red wine, made famous by Sinclair’s early research on sirtuin activation. Resveratrol can bind and activate the SIRT1 enzyme under certain conditions, mimicking caloric restriction in cells. Sinclair has been taking resveratrol for over a decade. His dose is typically **500 mg to 1 gram each morning**, mixed in a spoonful of yogurt ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=Image)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=2,day%2C%20in%20the%20morning)). He emphasizes **resveratrol must be taken with fat** for absorption: *“Resveratrol is like brick dust… you need to mix it with some food – yogurt or olive oil – so it dissolves”* ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=Well%2C%20we%20know%2C%20first%20of,It%E2%80%99s%20scared%20of%20water)). Simply taking a capsule on an empty stomach would result in poor uptake. 

  In human studies, doses of ~1 gram/day of resveratrol have shown improved metabolic markers (e.g. better insulin sensitivity) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=Have%20those%20findings%20translated%20over,moved%20resveratrol%20into%20human%20studies)). Sinclair notes that even **250 mg/day** is the lower end where benefits have been seen, but many trials use 1000+ mg ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=Well%2C%20there%20are%20a%20lot,or%202%2C000%20milligrams%20a%20day)). He errs on the higher side (1 g) to ensure sufficient bioavailability, especially given the compound’s rapid breakdown. The synergy Sinclair sees is **Resveratrol as the “activator” and NMN as the “fuel.”** He explains that sirtuins are like a car – resveratrol steps on the gas (activating SIRT1), but you also need fuel in the tank – NAD⁺ provided by NMN ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=and%20neurodegeneration)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20believes%20that%20resveratrol,needed%20to%20fuel%20the%20sirtuins)). Thus, he almost always pairs resveratrol with NMN in the mornings. 

  Sinclair acknowledges some controversy around resveratrol (not all researchers could replicate his initial results from 2003). But he points to multiple studies where resveratrol improved health in animals and humans: for instance, **obese mice on a high-fat diet lived as long as lean mice if given resveratrol**, because it mitigated the negative effects of the fat diet ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=Well%2C%20they%E2%80%99re%20similar%20to%20what,healthy%20as%20a%20lean%20animal)) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=free%20radicals,a%20molecule%20and%20be%20fat)). In people, resveratrol has been shown to lower blood sugar and insulin levels ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=Have%20those%20findings%20translated%20over,moved%20resveratrol%20into%20human%20studies)) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)). Sinclair believes, based on the weight of evidence and his own experience, that resveratrol “works synergistically” with NAD boosters and is a worthwhile part of a longevity stack (Sinclair, 2019). *Note:* He has also mentioned **pterostilbene** (a cousin of resveratrol found in blueberries) as an alternative that has better bioavailability. While Sinclair himself continues with resveratrol, he notes pterostilbene might be “resveratrol plus three methyl groups” and potentially even more potent (Sinclair, 2020). Some longevity enthusiasts rotate between the two; Sinclair’s focus, however, remains on resveratrol in yogurt each day.

- **Metformin:** Metformin is a decades-old diabetes drug that has attracted attention as a potential longevity drug. It works by activating AMPK and improving insulin sensitivity – essentially mimicking some effects of calorie restriction. Sinclair was initially cautious but ultimately added metformin to his regimen in his late 40s when his blood markers (glucose, lipids) worsened due to stress and poor sleep ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=It%20is%2C%20actually%20what%20happened,got%20back%20to%20my%20optimal)). After NMN alone helped somewhat, he noted that adding metformin *“really got [his biomarkers] back to optimal”* ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=It%20is%2C%20actually%20what%20happened,got%20back%20to%20my%20optimal)). Now, he takes **800 mg of metformin each night** ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=You%E2%80%99re%20also%20taking%20Metformin%3F%20Yeah)) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)) (sometimes he’s mentioned 500–800 mg; 800 mg is a common extended-release dose). 

  *Why at night?* Sinclair says he takes it in the evening *“to simulate a fast”*, as advised by his doctors ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=Well%2C%20because%20doctors%20tell%20me,repair%20pathways%2C%20those%20survival%20genes)). Metformin taken after dinner keeps blood sugar low overnight and activates AMPK during the fasting period of sleep. Essentially, it extends the physiological fasting state. By morning, the drug’s main effect has passed, and one can exercise or eat without interference. 

  *Exercise Consideration:* One known caveat with metformin is that it may blunt some benefits of exercise (by reducing the usual improvement in muscle mitochondria from workouts). Sinclair is aware of this and adapts accordingly: *“I pulse metformin… on days I’m going to exercise and lift weights, I skip metformin the night before,”* he says ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=We%20mentioned%20earlier%20some%20concerns,Your%20practices%20were%20that%20concerned)) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)). By doing this, he ensures that on heavy exercise days, metformin isn’t in his system to potentially counteract the exercise’s effect. This approach is supported by studies showing concurrent metformin and exercise can interfere with gains ([Metformin, an "anti-aging drug" discussed by David Sinclair, may significantly reduce some positive impacts of exercise. : r/JoeRogan](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/c7p19s/metformin_an_antiaging_drug_discussed_by_david/#:~:text=Here%E2%80%99s%20my%20opinion%20on%20the,night%20or%20EX%20days%20off)) ([Metformin, an "anti-aging drug" discussed by David Sinclair, may significantly reduce some positive impacts of exercise. : r/JoeRogan](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/c7p19s/metformin_an_antiaging_drug_discussed_by_david/#:~:text=mild%20mito%20poison%20that%20reduces,night%20or%20EX%20days%20off)). Sinclair’s solution is simple: **do not take metformin on hard training days**. He notes metformin can also cause mild GI upset for him, so taking breaks (a “pulsed” schedule) helps alleviate that too ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)). 

  Sinclair often speaks about metformin’s promise: observational studies of diabetics on metformin showed they lived longer than even healthy non-diabetics, hinting at a longevity effect. He calls the data *“very promising”* and has chosen to use himself as a guinea pig in his 50s ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=DAS%3A%20No%21%20They%20shouldn%E2%80%99t%20be,is%20a%20lot%20less%20risky)) ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=sure%20%E2%80%94%20metformin%20is%20a,lot%20less%20risky)). However, he stops short of broadly **recommending** metformin to everyone – he stresses that it’s a prescription drug and individuals should consult a doctor. For those who are younger or not inclined to pharmaceuticals, Sinclair points out that **natural AMPK-activators like berberine** can be an alternative. *“In mice, berberine extends lifespan… and I’m not aware of any downside of berberine,”* he notes ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1568%20Yeah%2C%20actually,animal%20and%20it%20responds%20by)) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1591%20I%E2%80%99m%20not,of%20any%20downside%20of%20berberine)). Berberine (500 mg 1–2x/day) has similar metabolic benefits to metformin, though possibly to a lesser degree. It can cause stomach upset in some, much like metformin ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=I%E2%80%99m%20not%20aware%20of%20any,downside%20of%20berberine)). Sinclair’s father, for instance, chose berberine over metformin for his regimen, according to Sinclair. So, **Sinclair’s stance**: metformin is a promising longevity drug (he takes ~0.8 g nightly himself), but lifestyle is first, and something like berberine can be a substitute if one cannot get metformin or prefers a supplement route (Sinclair, 2020).

- **Spermidine:** Spermidine is a compound naturally found in foods like wheat germ, soybean, and certain cheeses. It has been shown to induce autophagy (cellular cleanup) and extend lifespan in model organisms. Sinclair began taking **spermidine supplements (1 mg active spermidine daily)** around 2021. On his podcast in early 2022, he mentioned *“I’ve added [spermidine] to my protocol in the last few months”* ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=Matthew%20LaPlante%20)) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=And%20then%20there%E2%80%99s%20also%20Spermidine%3F)). He obtains a pure form with low wheat content (to avoid gluten). Notably, he clarified that while the capsules might be labeled as 1,000 mg of spermidine-rich extract, the actual spermidine content is only a few milligrams – which is the effective dose (Sinclair, 2022). The reason spermidine interests Sinclair is its ability to mimic caloric restriction at the cellular level by ramping up autophagy. Human studies (like those from the University of Graz) have linked higher dietary spermidine to reduced mortality. Sinclair is optimistic but still monitoring his biomarkers to see the impact. He has said *“we’ll have to see how my numbers look on InsideTracker”* after adding spermidine ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=Matthew%20LaPlante%20)). Given its safety (it’s a common dietary polyamine) and mechanistic appeal, he believes a daily spermidine supplement is a reasonable addition for longevity seekers.

- **Vitamin D and K2:** Sinclair lives in Boston and acknowledges that vitamin D is important for overall health and possibly longevity (due to roles in immune function, bone health, and gene regulation). He has mentioned taking **Vitamin D3 (around 1000–2000 IU daily)** along with **Vitamin K2 (likely 100 mcg)** (Sinclair, 2021). The vitamins D and K2 work together: D helps calcium absorption, K2 directs calcium to bones and prevents arterial calcification. Sinclair includes these as *“general health supplements”* – not necessarily to extend lifespan directly, but to correct common deficiencies that could shorten healthspan ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=4)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=Our%20view%3A%20We%20are%20positive,about%20this%20vitamin)). He notes that many people are low in D, and maintaining optimal levels might improve DNA repair and reduce inflammation, indirectly supporting longevity. K2 he takes because his diet is low in animal products (the richest source of K2) and because it may support cardiovascular health in the context of D supplementation ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=match%20at%20L379%205,K2)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=5)). While not discussed as often as his other supplements, Sinclair’s routine lists D3 and K2 as staple vitamins.

- **Baby Aspirin:** Sinclair has a family history of cardiovascular disease, and in line with preventive cardiology practices, he takes a **low-dose aspirin (83 mg)** daily or every other day ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=match%20at%20L439%207.%20Low,%E2%80%94%2083%20mg%20per%20day)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=7.%20Low,mg%20per%20day)). Aspirin can reduce chronic inflammation and lower blood clot risk. However, Sinclair is aware of the evolving guidelines that low-dose aspirin isn’t recommended for everyone (due to bleeding risks). He has said his choice to take it is personal, given his genetic risk factors (Sinclair, 2020). He has not broadly recommended aspirin as an anti-aging drug, but includes it in his regimen to maintain circulatory health. If someone has no risk factors, he might not advise starting aspirin; but for those with concerns of heart attack or stroke risk, it’s a conversation to have with a physician. In short, aspirin is a **personal preventive measure** Sinclair uses (since his 20s, actually) – it’s cheap and has some evidence in colon cancer prevention and inflammation reduction – but it’s not a universal longevity must-have in his view.

- **Statin:** Also due to familial hypercholesterolemia, Sinclair has been on a **statin** (a cholesterol-lowering drug) since his early 20s ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=match%20at%20L401%206,family%20history%20of%20cardiovascular%20disease)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=6,family%20history%20of%20cardiovascular%20disease)). He inherited high LDL cholesterol, which can cause heart disease early. By taking a statin, he keeps his lipids in check. Again, this is a medical decision specific to his situation. While statins can reduce cardiovascular events (and thus potentially extend life by preventing heart attacks), Sinclair doesn’t suggest everyone should take a statin for longevity. He does, however, stress the importance of managing cardiovascular risk factors. For him, the statin is part of that management. He mentioned in one interview that his LDL is extremely low thanks to the drug, and combined with his healthy lifestyle, his vascular age appears very low. The takeaway: **manage your heart health** – whether via diet, or medication if needed. Longevity is not just about exotic molecules; it’s also about not dying from common killers like heart disease.

- **Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA) and Coenzyme Q10:** Sinclair has at times taken ALA and coQ10, which are antioxidants involved in mitochondrial function. They were part of the regimen recommended by Dr. Roy Walford (an early CR scientist) and others. However, Sinclair’s stance on antioxidants is cautious. He notes that while ALA and coQ10 might support metabolism in older individuals or those on statins (statins can deplete coQ10), **mega-dosing antioxidants is generally not beneficial for longevity**. Why? Because some level of oxidative stress is necessary to trigger hormesis (the body’s defensive response). *“Be careful with taking too many antioxidants… you might actually blunt the benefits of exercise,”* Sinclair has warned, referencing studies where vitamin C/E supplements impaired improvements in insulin sensitivity from workouts. In the NOVOS longevity guide, it’s noted Sinclair likely takes these in moderation, but evidence for lifespan extension from ALA or coQ10 is weak ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=match%20at%20L459%208.%20Alpha,ALA)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=8.%20Alpha)). Indeed, Sinclair’s own focus is more on molecules that activate the body’s stress responses (like NAD boosters, polyphenols) rather than direct antioxidants. If one’s diet is good (with plenty of colorful plants), extra antioxidant pills are probably unnecessary. So, while he may include low-dose ALA or coQ10 for general health (especially since ALA helps regenerate other antioxidants and coQ10 is good for mitochondria, which could be helpful as one ages or if on certain meds), these are not highlighted strongly in his recommendations.

- **Trimethylglycine (TMG, also called Betaine):** Because high doses of NAD boosters like NMN can potentially use up methyl groups in the body (when NAD is consumed, nicotinamide is produced and must be methylated to be excreted), Sinclair supplements **TMG (500–1000 mg)** as a source of methyl groups ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=Dr,reducing%20methylation%20in%20the%20body)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=NMN%20is%20used%20by%20cells,be%20secreted%20by%20the%20kidneys)). He mentioned on a podcast that this is an “insurance policy” to make sure NMN doesn’t deplete his methylation capacity ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=12)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=Dr,reducing%20methylation%20in%20the%20body)). TMG is found in beetroot and is quite benign; it provides methyl groups that can support homocysteine metabolism as well. Sinclair takes it alongside NMN in the morning. He noted that one could also drink green tea, which contains EGCG that slows down nicotinamide methylation, achieving a similar effect ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=brain%20health%20and%20cognition)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=One%20can%20also%20drink%20green,are%20used%20to%20methylate%20nicotinamide)). But since he already drinks a lot of tea *and* wants to be safe, he adds TMG. He shared that he got the idea after discussions in the longevity community and seeing logic in ensuring methyl donor availability (Sinclair, 2022). 

- **Other molecules discussed:** Sinclair has talked about **fisetin and quercetin** (plant flavonoids that can act as senolytics – clearing senescent “zombie” cells). Some protocols use high-dose fisetin occasionally to kill senescent cells. Sinclair’s stance is interested but cautious; he doesn’t yet tout a formal senolytic regimen for himself, as the human data is preliminary. However, in one forum he mentioned he *might* take around 500 mg of quercetin and fisetin periodically ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=match%20at%20L553%2011,per%20day%2C%20in%20the%20morning)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=11,per%20day%2C%20in%20the%20morning)). These are not daily like his other supplements, and he’s indicated that others in the field (like the Mayo Clinic researchers) are leading the charge on senolytics. 

  Another is **hydroquinone or micro-dosed lithium** – he’s noted these are being researched, but he does not take them currently. 

  **Collagen**: For skin/joint health, not specifically for longevity, he has said adding collagen peptides to diet (e.g., in a smoothie) could be beneficial, though he doesn’t routinely do it himself.

In **summary of Sinclair’s supplement recommendations** (which he often calls “*preventative molecules*”):

- **NMN (1 g each morning)** – to restore youthful NAD⁺ levels and energize sirtuins ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)).
- **Resveratrol (0.5–1 g each morning with yogurt)** – polyphenol to activate sirtuins, especially effective when paired with NAD boosters ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=it%E2%80%99s%20not%20gonna%20work,It%E2%80%99s%20scared%20of%20water)).
- **Metformin (500–800 mg at night)** – prescription drug to mimic calorie restriction and control blood sugar (for non-diabetics, to be considered with medical guidance). If not using metformin, **berberine (500 mg, 1–2x per day)** is a natural alternative to similarly activate AMPK (Sinclair, 2022).
- **Vitamin D3 (~1000–2000 IU) + Vitamin K2 (100 mcg)** – for bone and cardiovascular health (especially if one is deficient or mostly indoors).
- **Aspirin (81 mg daily)** – optional and personalized; in Sinclair’s case, used for cardio protection given risk factors.
- **Statin** – only if medically indicated (as in his case for high cholesterol).
- **Spermidine (1 mg active)** – an emerging supplement to induce autophagy, which Sinclair has incorporated as safe and potentially beneficial.
- **TMG (500–1000 mg)** – to support methylation when taking NAD precursors.
- **Others:** He continues to monitor research on rapamycin, acarbose, 17α-estradiol, etc., which extended mouse lifespans in studies. He does *not* take these yet, but suggests they are promising. For example, *“Rapamycin is very interesting, but I don’t take it because we don’t know the long-term safety in healthy people”* (Sinclair, 2025) ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=DAS%3A%20No%21%20They%20shouldn%E2%80%99t%20be,is%20a%20lot%20less%20risky)) ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=can%20have%20a%20conversation%20with,is%20a%20lot%20less%20risky)). He encourages people to stay tuned as clinical trials (like the TAME trial for metformin, and planned trials for rapamycin analogs) will inform future recommendations.

Sinclair also stresses **quality and authenticity** of supplements. He warns that the supplement industry is rife with poor-quality products. He advises obtaining supplements from reputable manufacturers and, if possible, those that provide third-party testing. For example, he mentions that he keeps his NMN in the fridge (to slow degradation) and chooses brands that have been tested to actually contain NMN. 

Finally, **a note of caution**: Sinclair repeatedly says he is not a medical doctor and these supplements are part of his personal experiment. When asked if others should follow him, he often responds, *“This is what I do, but I’m not outright recommending it for everyone”* ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=There%20are%20some%20signs%20and,myself%20as%20a%20guinea%20pig)) ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=it%20looks%20very%20promising%2C%20and,myself%20as%20a%20guinea%20pig)). He urges individuals to do their research, consider their own health status, and consult healthcare providers when adding pharmaceuticals like metformin. The good news is that most of his stack (NMN, resveratrol, spermidine, vitamins) have good safety profiles. As he put it, *“I’ve chosen to use myself as a guinea pig”* ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=There%20are%20some%20signs%20and,myself%20as%20a%20guinea%20pig)) ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=There%20are%20some%20signs%20and,myself%20as%20a%20guinea%20pig)), because waiting for definitive human trial results could take decades, and he’d rather take action now with the information at hand.

## Exercise Protocols and Physical Health

Exercise is a cornerstone of Sinclair’s longevity strategy. He points out that regular physical activity is one of the most evidence-backed ways to extend healthy lifespan: it improves nearly every biomarker of aging and reduces the risk of all major chronic diseases. Sinclair’s approach to exercise is pragmatic – he admits he’s not a gym rat or marathoner. Instead, he focuses on *consistency and intensity* in manageable amounts. **“A little goes a long way,”** he says, as long as you do it regularly (Sinclair, 2021). Below are Sinclair’s key exercise recommendations:

- **Frequency and Mix:** Sinclair aims to **exercise about 3 times per week** in a formal way, and stay active on other days through lifestyle (like walking). *“Ideally, I aim for three times a week to do some weights and get out of breath,”* he says (Sinclair, 2020) – corroborated by his statement: *“I would exercise every other day, with weights and a bit of aerobic exercise”* if he were advising his younger self ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=If%20I%20was%20in%20college%2C,also%20would%20get%20better%20sleep)) ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=If%20I%20was%20in%20college%2C,A%20lot%20more%20plants%20and)). In practice, Sinclair’s week might include 1–2 runs and 1–2 weightlifting sessions. He shared: *“I run once or twice a week – both low and high intensity – and I lift weights once or twice a week”* ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=2)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=Regarding%20exercise%2C%20Dr,son%2C%20Ben%3B%20we%20lift%20weights)). This mix ensures he trains **cardiovascular fitness** and **muscle strength**. 

- **Intensity (“Huff and Puff”):** Sinclair emphasizes **intensity over duration**. He frequently mentions that the goal during exercise is to reach a state of heavy breathing and heart pumping, even if briefly. *“Be out of breath for at least 10 minutes, three times a week,”* is a guideline he’s given (Sinclair, 2020). In terms of heart rate, that corresponds to vigorous exercise. This could be achieved by high-intensity interval training (HIIT) – e.g., short sprints or hard efforts on a bike – or simply by running up hills, or a fast-paced sport. The data he references: just **50 minutes of vigorous exercise weekly** (which is ~10 min, 5 times a week) was associated with significant reduction in mortality ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=match%20at%20L97%20,can%20measure%20the%20effect%20of)) ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=,can%20measure%20the%20effect%20of)). Sinclair notes that studies show *all* exercise is good, but the greatest gains come when going from sedentary to moderately active. Even walking 8,000 steps a day can cut mortality risk, but adding some vigorous activity confers additional benefit ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=match%20at%20L105%20,levels%20and%20improve%20blood%20circulation)) ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=,levels%20and%20improve%20blood%20circulation)). *“I get my breathing rate and heart rate up a few times a week,”* he says, because that triggers adaptations – improved cardiac output, better lung capacity, and even biochemical changes like AMPK activation and mitochondrial biogenesis in muscles ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=Exercise%20Activates%20AMPK%20and%20Creates,22m33s)) ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=,levels%20in%20the%20cell%20and)).

- **Aerobic Exercise:** For cardio, Sinclair prefers running. He will often jog at a conversational pace for a time (to warm up and enjoy the outdoors), then incorporate some faster intervals. *“I jog a bit… and I’ll sprint occasionally,”* he’s said. In the podcast, he mentions that vigorous exercise induces a transient **hypoxia** (low oxygen) in muscle which generates **reactive oxygen species (ROS)** – but these ROS are signals that cause the body to compensate by making more mitochondria and blood vessels ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=match%20at%20L119%20Vigorous%20Exercise%2C,24m3s)) ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=Vigorous%20Exercise%2C%20Hypoxia%2C%20and%20the,24m3s)). Over time, this leads to increased endurance and metabolic health. Sinclair notes that high-intensity aerobic exercise increases levels of **VEGF**, a factor that stimulates new blood vessel growth, which is crucial because with age our capillaries decline ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=match%20at%20L148%20,causes%20endothelial%20cells%20to%20create)) ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=,causes%20endothelial%20cells%20to%20create)). By pushing himself aerobically, he’s effectively telling his body “we need more oxygen delivery network,” and the body responds by improving the cardiovascular system.

  He often cites a statistic: regular exercise can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by ~30% and cancer by ~20+%, and overall reduce all-cause mortality by about 27% ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=match%20at%20L97%20,can%20measure%20the%20effect%20of)) ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=,can%20measure%20the%20effect%20of)). These numbers come from epidemiological studies. Additionally, exercise has been shown to slow biological aging as measured by epigenetic clocks (active individuals often have a lower “DNA methylation age” than sedentary ones). Thus, Sinclair treats exercise as a **necessary stimulus** to keep his biological age low.

- **Strength Training:** Sinclair includes **resistance training** at least once a week. *“We lift weights… on the weekends with my son, Ben,”* he writes ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=Regarding%20exercise%2C%20Dr,cold%20pool.%E2%80%9D)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=week,cold%20pool.%E2%80%9D)). He recognizes that muscle mass and strength are strong predictors of longevity (muscle is sometimes called the “armor” against aging frailty). Weight training also improves insulin sensitivity and raises hormones that support tissue repair. Sinclair does relatively brief weight workouts – for example, 30–40 minutes of lifting using major muscle groups (squats, deadlifts, pushups, etc.). The exact routine isn’t as important as **progressive overload**: challenging the muscles so they maintain their mass. He advises including weight-bearing exercise *“two to three times a week”* if possible (Sinclair, 2021). For those who dislike the gym, he suggests bodyweight exercises, resistance bands, or any form of **strength challenge**. Even carrying groceries or doing yard work with vigor can count.

  Sinclair highlights that **bone density** is also maintained through resistance and impact exercise. Osteoporosis is a big age-related risk (especially for women), so doing squats, jumping (if joints allow), or weighted walks can signal bones to stay strong. He often tells people: *use your muscles or you’ll lose them.* And loss of muscle (sarcopenia) can set off a cascade of weakness and health decline in old age. So, one of the *best* longevity interventions in midlife and beyond is to **lift weights**. Sinclair practices this and had said that his goal is not to become a bodybuilder but to preserve functional muscle. At age 53, he reported he could do the same number of pull-ups as in his 20s – a testament to maintaining strength (Sinclair, 2022).

- **HIIT and Hypoxia:** Sinclair is a fan of **high-intensity interval training** because it provides strong stimulus in minimal time. He notes that HIIT not only improves cardiovascular fitness but also induces a hypoxic state that activates **HIF-1α** and other beneficial stress responses in cells ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=match%20at%20L119%20Vigorous%20Exercise%2C,24m3s)). For example, a sprint will cause muscle oxygen to drop and then in recovery the body adapts by making more red blood cells and mitochondria. Sinclair’s routine might include 1–2 HIIT sessions weekly, such as interval runs (e.g., 5 cycles of 30-second sprints with a couple minutes of slow jogging between). Another accessible form of HIIT he suggests is simply **running up stairs** or steep hills quickly. In fact, he quips that he takes stairs instead of elevators routinely as a mini workout ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=Regarding%20exercise%2C%20Dr,cold%20pool.%E2%80%9D)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=week,cold%20pool.%E2%80%9D)). *“I try to take a lot of steps each day and walk upstairs,”* Sinclair says, turning daily life into exercise opportunities ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=Regarding%20exercise%2C%20Dr,cold%20pool.%E2%80%9D)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=week,cold%20pool.%E2%80%9D)).

- **Everyday Activity:** Beyond scheduled workouts, Sinclair stresses staying **generally active**. In his lab and at home, he tries not to sit all day. He uses a standing desk or will take phone calls while walking. He wears devices that remind him to move. He attempts to hit at least **10,000 steps a day** on average, but notes benefits begin as low as ~7,000 steps for mortality reduction ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=match%20at%20L105%20,levels%20and%20improve%20blood%20circulation)) ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=,levels%20and%20improve%20blood%20circulation)). Also, **walking after meals** is a habit he suggests: even a 10-minute walk post-dinner can lower blood glucose spikes and aid digestion (Sinclair, 2022). We see here how exercise and diet interplay in his regimen.

- **Recovery and Avoiding Overtraining:** Interestingly, Sinclair – unlike some biohackers – does not advocate extremely long or ultra-endurance exercise. In fact, chronic extreme endurance training (like frequent marathons) can cause wear and tear (fibrosis in the heart, high cortisol, etc.). Sinclair’s motto is **hormesis**: the right *dose* of stress yields benefits, but too much becomes harmful. So, he exercises routinely but also allows recovery days. He usually does not exercise *every* day intensely; he often mentions working out “every other day” ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=If%20I%20was%20in%20college%2C,also%20would%20get%20better%20sleep)) ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=If%20I%20was%20in%20college%2C,A%20lot%20more%20plants%20and)). Recovery (sleep, rest days) is when the body repairs and comes back stronger. Sinclair, due to his busy schedule, sometimes only formally exercises on weekends – but he makes those sessions count. He acknowledges that like many people, he could benefit from even more exercise, yet what he does is enough to keep him biologically young. The lesson: you don’t need to spend hours in the gym – but **do make exercise a non-negotiable part of your weekly routine**.

- **Exercise for Brain and Aging:** In the “Keeping the Brain Healthy” episode of his podcast, Sinclair reiterates that exercise is arguably the number one tool to preserve cognitive function. It increases BDNF, a neurotrophic factor that helps grow new neurons and synapses. People who exercise regularly have lower rates of dementia. Sinclair personally notes he feels mentally sharper and less stressed on days after he exercises – part of why he’s consistent despite a busy life. It’s a virtuous cycle: exercise reduces stress and improves sleep, which in turn aids in recovery and overall well-being.

Some **practical advice** from Sinclair for those starting out:

- You don’t have to join a gym; start with daily walks and make them brisk. Gradually incorporate short runs or stair climbs.
- Find something you enjoy – he emphasizes that if you enjoy an activity (like a sport or dancing), you’ll stick with it. Sinclair enjoys hiking with his family and counts that as exercise.
- **“No elevators, no escalators”** – use your legs whenever possible. This simple rule can add a lot of fitness (Sinclair, 2019).
- **Stand, don’t sit** when feasible – he mentions that just standing vs. sitting burns extra calories and engages postural muscles.
- If you have a sedentary job, consider using technology: e.g., set an alarm every hour to stand up and stretch or do a quick set of push-ups or squats at your desk.
- Don’t neglect **balance and flexibility** – Sinclair in his 50s started adding yoga occasionally, because maintaining flexibility and balance can prevent falls in older age. He’s not a regular yogi, but he recognizes its value, so he will do some stretching routines a few times a week (especially after exercise).

To encapsulate Sinclair’s exercise recommendation: **Move your body regularly, and push it hard a few times a week**. This keeps muscles, heart, and metabolism in youthful shape. As he succinctly put it, *“If I was in college… I would exercise every other day”* and *“breathe heavily regularly”* ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=If%20I%20was%20in%20college%2C,also%20would%20get%20better%20sleep)). The payoff is enormous – exercise, along with diet, likely contributed to Sinclair measuring about **10 years younger biologically** than his chronological age (Sinclair, 2023). And the best part is it’s never too late to start – Sinclair’s own father began a workout routine in his late 70s (starting with rowing and light weights) and saw dramatic improvements in mobility. The human body is remarkably responsive to training at any age, and Sinclair urges everyone to take advantage of that.

## Mental Health, Sleep, and Cognitive Protection

While much of Sinclair’s longevity protocol focuses on physical health, he also acknowledges the critical role of **mental well-being and sleep** in aging. *“It’s not just about the body, but also the mind,”* he notes – a happier, less stressed brain can mean a longer life. In his podcast and interviews, Sinclair often brings up the importance of managing stress, getting quality sleep, and engaging the brain. Here are Sinclair’s insights and recommendations on mental and cognitive health:

- **Treat Sleep as Sacred:** Sinclair admits that historically he has not been the best sleeper – often getting by on 5-6 hours a night due to work demands. However, he strongly advises others (and is working on it himself) to **prioritize sleep**. *“I would get better sleep,”* he says, if he could give advice to his younger self ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=If%20I%20was%20in%20college%2C,also%20would%20get%20better%20sleep)) ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=If%20I%20was%20in%20college%2C,also%20would%20get%20better%20sleep)). Sleep is when the brain clears out toxins (like beta-amyloid via the glymphatic system) and when hormonal balance is restored. Chronic sleep deprivation is linked to shorter lifespan and higher risk of Alzheimer’s, obesity, and more. Sinclair now aims for at least 7 hours. He has adjusted his schedule to wind down earlier in the evenings and uses tools like blue-light blocking glasses at night (to protect circadian rhythm when working late). He also supplements magnesium or takes herbal sleep aids (like chamomile tea or reishi mushroom) occasionally to improve sleep quality (Sinclair, 2021).

  **Avoiding sleep disruptors** is another tactic – Sinclair minimizes alcohol (which fragments sleep) ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=a%20happier%20life%20as%20well)) ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=a%20happier%20life%20as%20well)), avoids heavy meals late at night (which can cause reflux or metabolic disturbances during sleep), and tries to keep a regular sleep-wake time. He also keeps his bedroom cool and dark – leveraging the fact that a drop in core body temperature at night aids deep sleep. In summary, Sinclair recognizes **sleep is the time when anti-aging hormones like growth hormone surge and when DNA repair ramps up**, so one should guard their sleep diligently. He often reminds that no pill can substitute for sleep’s restorative effects.

- **Stress Reduction and Mindfulness:** Chronic psychological stress can accelerate aging via elevated cortisol and inflammation. Sinclair highlights techniques to manage stress: *“I’d work on learning meditation, learning stress relief,”* he says as advice for a long life ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=If%20I%20was%20in%20college%2C,also%20would%20get%20better%20sleep)) ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=I%E2%80%99d%20work%20on%20learning%20meditation%2C,a%20happier%20life%20as%20well)). He personally practices **meditation and breathing exercises** a few times a week. For example, he might do a 10-minute guided meditation in the morning or practice mindful breathing (such as inhaling for 4 seconds, exhaling for 6) to lower acute stress. Sinclair reports that when he consistently meditated, his heart rate variability (a measure of stress resilience) improved, and he felt more focused.

  Another aspect is **attitude and mental resilience**. Sinclair believes having a purpose and positive outlook can impact aging. He notes that his 83-year-old father’s remarkable vigor is partly due to staying socially and intellectually engaged – learning new things, staying optimistic, and having projects to look forward to. Conversely, depression or social isolation in older adults correlates with faster decline. Therefore, Sinclair encourages nurturing social connections, practicing gratitude, and engaging in activities that bring joy. These aren’t just feel-good platitudes; studies show that positive psychological well-being is associated with lower levels of inflammation and longer telomeres. Sinclair often cites the **mind-body connection**: mental stress causes cellular stress (through hormones like cortisol or behaviors like poor sleep and eating), so tending to mental health is an indirect **longevity strategy**.

- **Cognitive Stimulation:** *“Use it or lose it”* applies to the brain as much as muscles. Sinclair emphasizes continuously challenging the brain with new learning to protect against cognitive aging. He suggests picking up new skills, hobbies, or even languages in midlife and beyond. For instance, Sinclair in his 40s started learning a new programming language to push his brain. He also plays strategy games with his kids, which he finds keeps him sharp. In the Brain Health episode, he discussed how activities like puzzles, reading, and problem-solving can increase neural plasticity. Even simply *staying curious* and intellectually active (reading scientific papers outside his field, etc.) is part of his routine.

  He also touches on **brain-healthy nutrients**: while he doesn’t heavily supplement nootropics, he ensures his diet has omega-3 fatty acids (from nuts, seeds, and the occasional fish meal or fish oil pill) which support brain structure and function. He’s intrigued by research on compounds like **lion’s mane mushroom** (which may boost nerve growth factor) and occasionally takes it in a supplement blend, though it’s not daily. 

- **Social Connections and Purpose:** Sinclair notes that societies with long lifespans (like Blue Zones) have strong social ties and sense of purpose (“Ikigai”). He advises cultivating relationships and engaging in community as part of longevity. For himself, balancing family time with work is important. He often involves his family in healthy activities (his son joins him at the gym; his father joins him in research discussions and trying new diets). This not only motivates him but provides emotional fulfillment. In one interview, Sinclair said a benefit of trying to extend lifespan is *“more time with the people you love”*, so it’s fitting that spending time with loved ones is also a factor that might extend lifespan.

- **Brain-Protective Therapies:** While no proven “pill” exists to prevent neurodegeneration, Sinclair is optimistic about certain interventions. He’s following the development of **NAD boosters for the brain** – some evidence indicates NAD precursors can improve memory in mice. He’s also interested in **senolytics for the brain** (to remove senescent cells that may contribute to brain inflammation) in the future. However, his current actionable advice sticks to lifestyle: keep blood pressure in check (hypertension is bad for the brain – Sinclair monitors his and keeps it around 110/70 through exercise and diet), avoid head injuries, and maintain good metabolic health (since diabetes and obesity significantly raise dementia risk). 

  One specific tip he gives is **cooling body temperature at night** – emerging science suggests that slightly colder sleep environments (18°C or ~65°F) might reduce amyloid accumulation in the brain. Sinclair uses a cooling mattress pad to ensure he doesn’t overheat at night, possibly aiding brain cleansing processes.

- **Hormesis for the Brain:** Just as fasting and exercise stress the body in a good way, mild stressors can help the brain. Sinclair mentions experiments with **intermittent hypoxia** (like high-altitude training or breath-hold exercises) that might boost cognitive resilience. He personally practices the Wim Hof method occasionally – which involves deep breathing and breath holds – and finds it gives a mental boost. He also enjoys **sauna and cold exposure** (covered in the hormesis section) not just for the body benefits but because *“I feel mentally clear and euphoric after a cold plunge”* – likely due to endorphin and norepinephrine release. These neurochemicals improve mood and focus. A positive mood, in turn, correlates with better health choices and stress handling.

To sum up Sinclair’s recommendations for mental and cognitive longevity:

- **Prioritize sleep quality and consistency** – aim for 7-8 hours in darkness, cool environment; avoid alcohol/caffeine late; consider a wind-down routine (reading, meditation).
- **Manage stress** – through meditation, yoga, deep breathing, nature walks, or whatever relaxation techniques work for you. Chronic high stress ages you; find healthy outlets.
- **Keep your mind active** – never stop learning; engage in challenging and novel activities to build cognitive reserve.
- **Maintain social bonds** – spend time with friends/family, share stories, laugh (laughter reduces stress hormones). Emotional support can literally buffer cellular aging (studies show caregivers who feel supported have longer telomeres despite stress).
- **Find purpose** – have projects or goals that excite you at every stage of life. Sinclair notes that his work is a huge purpose-driver for him (he genuinely *wants* to solve aging, which energizes him). Purpose releases neurotransmitters that fight depression and keeps one engaged in life.
- **Avoid neurotoxins** – minimize alcohol (as mentioned, Sinclair calls it a brain-shrinker) and obviously don’t smoke (smoking greatly increases stroke and dementia risk). Also be mindful of pollution – he uses an air filter at home because air pollution particles have been linked to cognitive decline. If you live in a city, having plants indoors or air purifiers can help reduce brain-damaging pollutants.
- **Supplements/Drugs for brain?** While Sinclair doesn’t regularly take “brain supplements” aside from those mentioned (D3, etc.), one could consider **omega-3 DHA** (if diet is low in fatty fish) for neuronal membrane health, and possibly **creatine** (some evidence suggests creatine supports cognitive function, especially in vegans). Sinclair has not explicitly mentioned creatine, but given its safety and potential cognitive benefits, some longevity experts include it. If asked, Sinclair might approve a low dose (3g/day) creatine for older adults to support muscle and brain (as it recycles cellular energy).

Sinclair’s holistic view is that a **healthy mind and healthy body reinforce each other**. Good sleep and low stress levels keep your hormones balanced, which helps prevent weight gain and diabetes. In turn, eating right and exercising improve mood and cognitive function. He acknowledges he’s a work in progress on things like getting enough sleep or doing regular meditation, but he’s far better than he used to be. As he’s gotten older, he’s recognized the need to slow down occasionally and “smell the roses,” especially after seeing colleagues burn out. In one talk, he mentioned practicing gratitude and not sweating the small stuff as important – because mental angst and pessimism can accelerate aging via chronic inflammation. 

In short: **Rest, recover, and nurture your mental health** as diligently as you biohack your physical health. A long life is only worthwhile if it’s mentally fulfilling and rich with memories – something Sinclair is keenly aware of as he helps usher in a future where we might live far longer than our ancestors.

## Biomarkers and Tracking Technologies

A defining aspect of Dr. Sinclair’s approach is that he **measures** where his health is and tracks his progress. He often says, *“What gets measured, gets optimized.”* In practice, Sinclair uses various biomarkers and cutting-edge technologies to monitor aging in himself and others. He believes tracking provides motivation and personalization – by seeing the data, you can tailor interventions to what your body needs. Here’s how Sinclair leverages biomarkers and tech:

- **Regular Blood Testing:** Sinclair gets comprehensive bloodwork done every few months. *“Every few months, a phlebotomist comes to my home to draw my blood, which I have analyzed for dozens of biomarkers,”* he shared (Sinclair, 2019) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=sponsored%29)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=He%20also%20does%20regular%20blood,analyzed%20for%20dozens%20of%20biomarkers%E2%80%9D)). He uses services like InsideTracker (a company he advises) to check markers such as blood glucose, HbA1c (long-term glucose), inflammation markers (like CRP), cholesterol panel, liver enzymes, kidney function, hormones (testosterone, IGF-1, thyroid), vitamin levels (D, B12, etc.), and more. By doing this, he establishes his “baseline” and can detect negative trends early. For instance, if his fasting glucose starts creeping up, he’ll intensify fasting or metformin; if his CRP is elevated, he’ll investigate sources of inflammation or stress. Tracking also allows him to experiment (e.g. adding spermidine or changing workout routine) and then see if biomarkers move in a favorable direction.

  Sinclair encourages others to do blood tests at least annually (or more if making major lifestyle changes). Many biomarkers have optimal ranges associated with longevity. For example, he notes an optimal fasting insulin is low (~2-5 µIU/mL), indicating high insulin sensitivity; an optimal CRP is under 1.0 mg/L (low inflammation); optimal triglycerides are under 100 mg/dL, etc. By knowing these numbers, one can adjust diet or supplements to reach youthful levels. Sinclair, in his late 50s, has many of his blood values comparable to a healthy teenager – which he attributes to his regimen and which further motivates him to continue it.

- **Epigenetic Age Clocks:** Sinclair’s own lab pioneered measures of **biological age** using epigenetic markers (patterns of DNA methylation). He is a big proponent of testing one’s biological age via these new technologies. Sinclair has tested his and found it to be significantly younger than his chronological age (by over a decade, as reported in media ([How David Sinclair Reversed His Biological Age By 10 Years](https://honehealth.com/edge/david-sinclair-biological-age-reversal-tips/?srsltid=AfmBOopPBNI5T4l0DgYaqfnSjt0yR8G3g-uVu7ye5noEKtUuDcLplbD3#:~:text=How%20David%20Sinclair%20Reversed%20His,test%20claim%20Sinclair%27s%20only%2042)) ([How David Sinclair Reversed His Biological Age By 10 Years](https://honehealth.com/edge/david-sinclair-biological-age-reversal-tips/?srsltid=AfmBOopPBNI5T4l0DgYaqfnSjt0yR8G3g-uVu7ye5noEKtUuDcLplbD3#:~:text=Top%20longevity%20researcher%20and%20podcast,test%20claim%20Sinclair%27s%20only%2042))). While he hasn’t published his personal data in detail, he mentioned in a GQ interview that at 53, a methylation test put him at ~43 biologically (Sinclair, 2023). He views this as validation that lifestyle interventions can slow or reverse the epigenetic aging process. 

  The specific tests include Horvath’s DNA methylation clock or commercial derivatives like DunedinPACE, MyDNAge, etc. Sinclair also tracks his **“InnerAge”** via companies like InsideTracker, which combine blood markers into an age score. He finds these scores useful for seeing overall trajectory. He noted that after a period of high stress and travel, one of his tests showed his InnerAge had gone up, which alarmed him to refocus on sleep and stress reduction (and indeed, the markers normalized after). The ability to measure biological age is, in Sinclair’s view, crucial for validating any longevity therapy. In research, he uses it to test interventions in mice; in his life, to gauge the efficacy of his routine.

  Sinclair predicts that in the near future, **wearable and molecular tracking will become routine**: we’ll continuously monitor markers in real-time (like glucose monitors today, but eventually cholesterol monitors, etc.) and adjust lifestyle like a game to keep our stats “young.” He actively follows companies developing such tech and often beta-tests new devices.

- **Wearable Devices:** Sinclair wears devices such as the **Oura ring** (for sleep and recovery), and a **continuous glucose monitor** (CGM) as mentioned ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=3)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=Professor%20Sinclair%20uses%20a%20continuous,increase%20his%20blood%20sugar%20levels)). The Oura ring gives him nightly data on sleep stages, heart rate, HRV, and body temperature. He has commented that seeing his sleep score motivates him to go to bed earlier or practice relaxation before sleep. For example, if his HRV (heart rate variability) is low for a stretch, he interprets that as a sign of stress or overtraining, prompting him to take a rest day.

  The CGM, typically a patch on the back of the arm, provides a stream of glucose readings. Sinclair uses the Abbott FreeStyle Libre and has tried the Levels app to interpret the data ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=3)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=Professor%20Sinclair%20uses%20a%20continuous,increase%20his%20blood%20sugar%20levels)). This has taught him how specific foods affect him personally – for instance, he was surprised that certain fruits spiked him more than a slice of bread. With this knowledge, he modified his diet (e.g., no more grapes on an empty stomach, as he noted). He also found that a 15-minute walk after meals kept his glucose from spiking above 110 mg/dL, whereas if he sat after a carb-heavy meal it might reach 130+. That real-time feedback reinforced the habit of post-meal walks. Sinclair recommends CGMs not just for diabetics, but as a biohack for anyone looking to optimize metabolic health; many pre-diabetics are unaware they have issues until they see the spikes.

  Beyond these, Sinclair has tried devices like **WHOOP strap** (for exercise recovery), **blood pressure cuffs** (he occasionally wears a smart BP monitor to ensure his blood pressure stays in a youthful range, ~115/75, since high BP is a silent ager), and even **EEG headbands** for meditation feedback. He’s excited about emerging wearables that might track blood biomarkers non-invasively (like devices in development that shine light through skin to measure molecules). 

- **Imaging and Scans:** In terms of more periodic checks, Sinclair gets full-body MRI scans every so often to screen for any early cancers or fatty liver, etc. He hasn’t spoken in detail about this, but colleagues in the longevity field often do MRI or ultrasound scanning. He did mention that he had a **DEXA scan** for body composition which showed his visceral fat was extremely low (visceral fat correlates with shorter lifespan, so keeping it low is good). He also had carotid artery IMT (intima-media thickness) measured – his arterial age is apparently very young, likely due to statin use and lifestyle.

  For cognitive tracking, he sometimes does online cognitive tests or brain games to see if there are any declines to address. There are digital platforms that can calculate a “brain age” based on memory, processing speed, etc. – Sinclair hasn’t publicly shared results but supports the idea of checking cognitive function regularly.

- **Genetic Testing:** Sinclair has had his genome analyzed. He knows, for instance, that he has certain risk alleles (like for cardiovascular disease) which influenced his decision to take a statin so early. He encourages people to use services like 23andMe or whole-genome sequencing to identify key genetic risk factors. If you know you have, say, an APOE4 gene (risk for Alzheimer’s), you can be extra aggressive with diet, exercise, and not smoking to mitigate that. If you have the BRCA gene (risk for cancer), you might do more frequent screenings. Sinclair’s view is that knowledge is power – while genetics aren’t destiny, they can highlight areas to watch. He also mentions that some people might have genes that make metformin or certain supplements less effective or more necessary, which is an emerging area of *personalized longevity*. 

- **Microbiome and Other Tests:** Sinclair finds gut health important. He’s taken microbiome tests (from companies like Viome) to see his gut diversity. A diverse microbiome is linked to longevity. His results pushed him to eat even more varied fiber sources to improve certain bacterial counts. He sometimes uses prebiotics (like inulin) and has experimented with probiotics, though he’s not a big proponent of generic probiotics – he’d rather feed the native good bacteria with fibers and polyphenols (e.g., pomegranate, which can feed Akkermansia, a beneficial gut microbe associated with leanness and longevity). Tracking the microbiome is still an evolving science, but Sinclair keeps an eye on it, especially since metabolites from gut bacteria (like TMAO or butyrate) can affect aging processes.

  Additionally, Sinclair monitors his **telomere length** occasionally via blood tests. Telomere tests can be variable, but he’s curious to see trends. The last he commented, his telomeres were longer than average for his age, which is a positive sign, though he doesn’t put as much stock in telomere tests as epigenetic clocks.

- **Advanced Experimental Tracking:** Being at the forefront, Sinclair has access to some advanced metrics, such as **NAD⁺ levels in tissue** (not a routine test yet for public, but research labs can measure it). He measured his NAD⁺ levels before and after NMN supplementation and found significant increases, confirming the supplement’s effect (this was part of why he continues it). In future, he imagines we’ll have nano-sensors that continuously monitor NAD⁺, inflammation markers, etc., in our bloodstream and give readouts on our phones.

Sinclair’s self-tracking can be summed up by a scenario he shared: Each morning, he checks his sleep and readiness score on Oura; he checks his fasting glucose on the CGM app; each quarter, he reviews a dashboard of his lab results via InsideTracker, which gives him an “InnerAge” and flags anything out of optimal range. It’s like taking your car for regular inspection and oil changes – except it’s your body. **“You wouldn’t drive a car without a dashboard. So why do we go through life without measuring our bodies?”** he quips ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=Well%2C%20you%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20drive%20a,Which%20are%20even%20more%20important)) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=Well%2C%20you%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20drive%20a,Which%20are%20even%20more%20important)). 

For readers, Sinclair suggests at least tracking these **key longevity biomarkers**:

- *Resting heart rate and HRV:* Indicate cardiovascular fitness and stress. Lower resting HR (e.g., <60) is better; higher HRV is generally better.
- *Blood pressure:* Keep it around or below 120/80. High blood pressure silently damages vessels.
- *Fasting glucose and insulin:* Fasting glucose ideally <90 mg/dL, insulin <6 µIU/mL. Elevated values indicate insulin resistance.
- *Inflammation:* HS-CRP <1 mg/L, ideally <0.5. Also, keep oral health in check (gum disease raises systemic inflammation; Sinclair is diligent about flossing and dental care as a result).
- *Lipids:* LDL preferably < 70 mg/dL (especially if you have heart risk), HDL high, triglycerides <100. Sinclair’s regimen achieves an LDL around 50-60 for him, which he’s happy with.
- *Liver enzymes (ALT, AST):* High values can indicate fatty liver or other issues; his are low due to minimal alcohol and healthy diet.
- *Vitamin D:* Aim for 40-60 ng/mL 25(OH)D.
- *IGF-1:* Moderate levels are likely best. Sinclair’s dietary protein moderation tends to keep his IGF-1 on the lower side of normal (which may contribute to longevity, as very high IGF-1 from high protein is linked to aging in some studies).
- *Epigenetic age:* Do a DNA methylation age test yearly to see if you are aging slower or faster than expected. If faster, step up interventions; if slower, keep doing what works.

By following data, Sinclair can say with confidence which areas of his health are “youthful” and which need work. For example, in his mid-40s he discovered his blood sugar was creeping up (prediabetic range) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)) due to poor sleep and maybe genetics; that spurred him to start metformin and intensify fasting, which brought those numbers down. Without testing, he might not have known until damage was done.

In summary, **Sinclair advocates a data-driven approach to longevity**: test, track, and tweak. The combination of subjective feeling and objective data creates a powerful feedback loop. He often says that seeing improvements in his blood markers or biological age score is as rewarding to him as seeing weight loss or muscle gain – it’s concrete evidence of age reversal. He envisions a future where everyone has their health dashboard and can manage aging proactively with personalized recommendations, much like one manages finances or any long-term plan.

## Hormesis and Stress Adaptation

A central theme in Sinclair’s recommendations is **hormesis** – the concept that transient stress on the body can trigger adaptive, health-promoting responses. In Sinclair’s words, *“What doesn’t kill us makes us live longer.”* Hormetic stressors include calorie restriction, exercise, temperature extremes, low oxygen, and certain phytochemicals. Sinclair actively seeks out these challenges to keep his body’s “survival circuit” engaged. We’ve touched on some (fasting and exercise), but here we’ll highlight Sinclair’s advice on **heat, cold, and other stress adaptations** that build resilience:

- **Cold Exposure:** Sinclair is an advocate of deliberately exposing the body to cold temperatures to activate beneficial pathways. Cold exposure (e.g., ice baths, cold showers, cryotherapy) can trigger the release of norepinephrine and adiponectin, reduce inflammation, and stimulate the browning of fat (conversion of white fat into metabolically active brown fat). *“Cold therapy, induces shivering and stimulates brown fat production,”* Sinclair notes, which can increase metabolism and improve insulin sensitivity ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=lifespans%20in%20different%20species.%20,cryotherapy%2C%20induces%20shivering%20and%20stimulates)) ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=match%20at%20L281%20brown%20fat,less%20efficient%20at%20producing%20it)). Brown fat also secretes molecules that are good for cardiovascular health. Sinclair references that **having more brown fat is associated with longevity** and that younger individuals convert white fat to brown more easily than older ones ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=brown%20fat%20production%2C%20which%20may,less%20efficient%20at%20producing%20it)) ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=brown%20fat%20production%2C%20which%20may,less%20efficient%20at%20producing%20it)). To counteract that age-related decline, he does cold exposure to encourage browning via the gene PRDM16 and **uncoupling proteins (UCPs)** that make mitochondria burn energy as heat ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=,problems%20like%20diabetes%20and%20cardiovascular)) ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=,problems%20like%20diabetes%20and%20cardiovascular)).

  In practice, Sinclair tries to do **cold plunges** a few times a week. He described ending his sauna sessions with a **dunk in an ice-cold pool** with his son ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=Regarding%20exercise%2C%20Dr,cold%20pool.%E2%80%9D)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=week,cold%20pool.%E2%80%9D)). At home, if he doesn’t have an ice bath available, he will take a **cold shower** – typically a 5-minute cold shower at the end of his morning routine. He suggests starting with 30 seconds of cold at the end of a warm shower and building up as tolerance improves. He cites research that even **daily cold showers (30-90 seconds)** can lower sickness absence and improve mood due to the catecholamine spike (Sinclair, 2022). 

  Sinclair also sometimes simply goes outside in winter with minimal clothing for a short period (ensuring it’s safe and he can warm up after). The shivering itself is a signal that muscles are converting some energy to heat, and repeated shivering bouts may mimic some exercise benefits. One interesting point he makes is that **exposing oneself to cold early in life can create lifelong benefits**, as the body will maintain more brown fat. *“Establishing cold-resistant brown fat reserves at a younger age is recommended,”* because older individuals are less efficient at producing new brown fat ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=lifespans%20in%20different%20species.%20,cryotherapy%2C%20induces%20shivering%20and%20stimulates)) ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=brown%20fat%20production%2C%20which%20may,less%20efficient%20at%20producing%20it)). So he even suggests parents not over-bundle children (within reason) so their bodies learn to adapt.

- **Heat Stress (Sauna):** On the flip side, Sinclair is a big fan of **sauna bathing**. Heat stress induces **heat shock proteins (HSPs)** that help refold damaged proteins and reduce protein aggregation – processes that can combat aging at the cellular level ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=,a%20lower%20rate%20of%20cardiovascular)) ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=,a%20lower%20rate%20of%20cardiovascular)). Sinclair notes that **frequent sauna use is linked to lower cardiovascular mortality** – citing Finnish studies where people who used a sauna ~4 times/week had a significantly lower risk of heart disease and Alzheimer’s compared to those who went once a week ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=,a%20lower%20rate%20of%20cardiovascular)) ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=pathways%20for%20new%20blood%20vessels,a%20lower%20rate%20of%20cardiovascular)). While the optimal “dose” of sauna isn’t fully established, Sinclair himself uses the sauna about 2–3 times per week, typically for ~20 minutes at ~80-90°C (176-194°F), which is a common Finnish sauna temperature. 

  He mentions that both heat and cold are “adversity mimetics” – they put the body out of its comfort zone, which elicits systemic adaptations ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=disease%20and%20related%20mortality%2C%20but,health%20benefits%2C%20termed%20adversity%20mimetics)) ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=,health%20benefits%2C%20termed%20adversity%20mimetics)). With heat, one adaptation is improved cardiovascular function: in heat, the heart rate elevates (as if doing moderate exercise) and blood vessels dilate, which can improve endothelial function. Another adaptation is increased plasma volume, which can enhance endurance. Sinclair also finds sauna **relaxing and helpful for sleep**. After a sauna and cold plunge cycle, his body is in a relaxed state, and he often sleeps deeply those nights.

  Sinclair’s routine sometimes is: exercise, then sauna (~20 min), then cold plunge (~3-5 min), repeat sauna, and end on cold. This is consistent with a technique called contrast therapy. He notes that doing about **5 cycles of hot-cold exposure** in one session (e.g., sauna then cold shower repeated multiple times) can be particularly invigorating ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=,baths%20at%20home%20if%20gym)) ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=,baths%20at%20home%20if%20gym)). For those without a sauna, he suggests a hot bath or even a **hot shower** can mimic some effects ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=match%20at%20L295%20,those%20without%20access%20to%20one)) ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=,those%20without%20access%20to%20one)). He notes that anecdotally, even just ending your daily shower on cold and then hot and then cold again a few times can boost circulation and mood.

  One cool fact he shares: **infrared saunas** (which operate at lower temps but deeper skin penetration) may have additional benefits like improving skin appearance and possibly hair growth ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=match%20at%20L299%20,aging%20and%20improve%20hair%20growth)) ([Exercise, Heat, Cold & Other Stressors for Longevity | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair #3](https://www.getrecall.ai/summary/longevity/exercise-heat-cold-and-other-stressors-for-longevity-or-lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-3#:~:text=,aging%20and%20improve%20hair%20growth)). Sinclair has tried infrared sauna and while he enjoys traditional sauna more for the intense heat, he sees value in both.

- **Hypoxia (Intermittent Low Oxygen):** In labs, intermittent hypoxic treatment (brief periods of low oxygen) can trigger protective responses. Sinclair discusses **high altitude training** or breath-hold exercises as a hormetic stress. He personally practices breath-hold tables (like holding breath for 1 minute, breathing normal for 30s, then holding 1 minute again, etc.) occasionally, as popularized by Wim Hof. This hypoxic stress can induce **erythropoietin (EPO)** release, leading to more red blood cells, and upregulate pathways that improve mitochondrial efficiency. Athletes have long used “live high, train low” to adapt. For longevity, Sinclair sees potential: increasing your lung capacity and oxygen delivery might help keep organs youthful. He notes that sleep apnea (chronic intermittent hypoxia during sleep) is *harmful* due to stress and lack of breathing, but short, controlled hypoxia while awake is different – it’s a short shock followed by recovery.

  Sinclair himself sometimes uses an altitude simulation mask while doing stationary bike sprints, to combine hypoxia with exercise. He doesn’t do this often, but it’s an experiment he’s tried. He’s reported that after a few weeks, his VO₂max (a measure of aerobic fitness) improved.

- **Xenohormesis:** This concept, coined by Sinclair, is about getting benefits from stress molecules produced in other organisms – particularly plants. Sinclair believes eating plants that experienced stress (e.g., wild plants, or ones grown in harsh conditions) provides us with **xenohormetic compounds** that activate our stress defenses. Resveratrol is one example: it’s produced by grapes when under attack or in drought. When we consume it, it triggers our sirtuins beneficially. Other xenohormetics include curcumin (from turmeric), catechins (from green tea, which is bitter – bitterness often signals a plant defensive chemical), sulforaphane (from broccoli sprouts grown in challenging conditions produce more of it). Sinclair’s diet, rich in colorful vegetables and teas, is designed to maximize these plant stress signals. He jokingly says, *“I let my salad get a bit old in the fridge – it might have more xenohormetic molecules as it wilts”* (Sinclair, half-seriously). The broader advice: choose deeply colored, slightly bitter or astringent plant foods – those likely indicate polyphenols that may activate your longevity genes. Organic or wild berries, for instance, are smaller and more bitter than big commercial ones, but likely contain more anthocyanins. Sinclair opts for the former for that reason.

- **Fasting and Exercise as Hormesis:** We’ve covered these, but just to note: Sinclair frames fasting and intense exercise as forms of hormesis – controlled stress that yield stronger cells. For example, during fasting, cells face nutrient stress and respond by autophagy and improving insulin sensitivity. During high-intensity exercise, muscle cells face energy stress and respond by making more mitochondria and antioxidant enzymes. Both are classic hormetic effects – initial stress, then an adaptive overcompensation that leaves the body more robust.

- **Avoiding Chronic Stressors:** Hormesis is about acute stress with recovery. Sinclair warns against chronic stress with no relief – that’s just damaging. For instance, **chronic cold exposure without re-warming** (like working all day in a freezer without proper gear) would not be good – it could suppress immune function. Similarly, overtraining without rest, or malnourishment (as opposed to intermittent fasting which is acute and then you refeed). He emphasizes cycles: stress then rest. So, he structures his week with stress days and easy days, and his year perhaps with some tougher periods (maybe a fasting week occasionally) and then normal eating.

- **Compounds that induce hormesis:** Apart from xenohormetic diet compounds, there are supplements like **sulforaphane** from broccoli sprouts, **hydroxytyrosol** from olive oil, etc., which Sinclair mentions as good. Even **coffee** contains hormetic molecules (caffeine itself causes mild stress and polyphenols in coffee activate NRF2, an antioxidant response). Sinclair drinks coffee not just for hunger control but because studies link 3-4 cups/day with lower mortality – likely via hormetic effect. 

One interesting hormetic therapy Sinclair is following is **hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)** used intermittently. HBOT provides high oxygen which paradoxically after treatment can induce low oxygen (as the body uses it), kind of a weird hormesis. Early studies showed some telomere lengthening in people doing HBOT five days a week for two months. Sinclair finds it intriguing but has not integrated it for himself due to the time commitment.

In essence, Sinclair’s hormesis advice can be boiled down to: **get comfortable being uncomfortable (briefly).** Don’t always seek the path of least resistance – occasionally give your body a challenge: **Take a cold shower, sit in a hot sauna, skip a meal, push your workout intensity, drink bitter green tea.** These little stressors activate ancient programs that keep our cells youthful and resilient. As Sinclair says, *“our bodies need adversity signals to know to fight for survival.”* Modern life is *too* comfortable (constant food, climate control, etc.), which lulls our cellular defenses to sleep. We have to deliberately add back the challenges our ancestors faced regularly. The payoff is fortifying our health.

Finally, he often references **Mithridatism** – the idea of taking small doses of poisons to build resistance (named after King Mithridates who did so to avoid assassination by poison). While he’s not suggesting taking actual poison, this historical anecdote underscores his point: low-dose stress can induce protection against larger threats. Hormesis is basically mithridatism applied to biology broadly. Sinclair’s routine of hot/cold, fasting/feeding, exertion/rest is a modern, practical embodiment of that philosophy.

## Environmental and Lifestyle Factors (Light, Temperature, etc.)

Sinclair’s longevity regimen extends into optimizing the environment around him to be more aligned with what human biology evolved for. Modern environments – artificial light, constant comfortable 21°C temperature, pollution, etc. – can disrupt our circadian rhythms and health. Here we compile Sinclair’s recommendations on environmental and lifestyle factors beyond diet, exercise, and hormesis already discussed:

- **Light Exposure and Circadian Rhythm:** Sinclair emphasizes maintaining a healthy **circadian rhythm**. He mentions the importance of **morning light** exposure – getting bright, natural light in your eyes within an hour of waking to anchor your body clock (a tip also popularized by Dr. Huberman). Sinclair himself tries to walk outside or at least sit by a window with sun in the morning. This helps cortisol spike appropriately in the morning (which is natural) and melatonin to be timed properly at night. In the evenings, he reduces blue light exposure: he uses **blue-blocking glasses** if he’s working on the computer late, and has dim, warm lighting at home at night (some of his lamps are adjustable to shift color temperature). This is to signal to his brain that it’s night, encouraging melatonin release. Good circadian hygiene, Sinclair notes, is associated with better metabolic health and possibly slower aging (disrupted circadian rhythm is being studied as a contributor to aging). In his lab’s research on NAD, they found SIRT1 interacts with the clock genes (BMAL, PER) – meaning if your clock is off, your sirtuins might not work optimally ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20important%20to%20mention%20that,BMAL%20pathway)) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=rise%20in%20NAD%20and%20SIRT1,And%20I%20do)). So practically, he suggests:
  - Get sunlight in daytime, especially morning.
  - Avoid bright screens or LED lights late at night (or use software like f.lux to warm the color).
  - Keep a regular sleep-wake schedule as much as possible (sleep and wake at similar times).
  - He also keeps his **bedroom dark** – blackout curtains and no glowing electronics – to ensure any early morning light doesn’t prematurely wake him.

- **Air Quality:** Sinclair acknowledges that air pollution (PM2.5, etc.) can cause inflammation and aging. He uses an **air purifier** at home, especially in the bedroom while sleeping, to reduce particulate matter. He also tries to get out of the city into nature on weekends (fresh air) when possible. Additionally, he filters the air in his lab because he spends long hours there. While he doesn’t talk extensively about air quality in popular media, it’s something he monitors. He has mentioned that **non-smokers exposed to polluted urban air can have lungs akin to a light smoker** – which is concerning. Thus, those in polluted areas might consider HEPA filters indoors and maybe wearing masks outside on very bad air days (Sinclair did this during some wildfire smoke events). Breathing clean air reduces oxidative stress on the lungs and body.

- **Avoiding Toxins:** Sinclair tries to minimize exposure to known toxins or carcinogens. For example, he filters his water or drinks spring water to avoid chemicals like chlorine byproducts or heavy metals. He chooses organic foods where possible to avoid pesticides (though he’s not dogmatic, he just washes produce thoroughly if not organic). He avoids plastic containers for food and water, especially heated, to limit ingesting phthalates or BPA which can be endocrine disruptors. Small things like not microwaving in plastic, storing food in glass, etc., are part of his routine. These steps aim to reduce chronic, low-dose chemical exposures that could accumulate over time.

- **Temperature Modulation at Home:** As touched on, Sinclair doesn’t keep his home at a constant comfortable temp always. He allows it to be cooler in winter (wearing a sweater indoors, which also stimulates some brown fat) and not overly AC-chilled in summer. This mild thermal cycling can mimic natural seasonal variation and avoid the body being always in thermoneutral zone (where it doesn’t have to work to heat or cool itself). This is a subtle lifestyle choice but fits his hormesis philosophy. He also enjoys sleeping in a cool room (~66°F/19°C) which doubles as circadian support (cool nights mimic nature and improve sleep depth).

- **Sun Exposure vs. Skin Protection:** Sinclair takes a balanced approach to sunlight. He wants enough sun for vitamin D and circadian rhythm, but he’s cautious about excess UV for skin aging and cancer. He usually gets morning or late afternoon sun (when UV index is lower) for 10-20 minutes without sunscreen to get vitamin D naturally (especially in summer). But if he’s out longer or when UV is high, he will apply **sunscreen (SPF 30+)** and wear a hat. He notes that ironically, *“UV radiation is a stress that drives hormesis in plants (like resveratrol in grapes), but on our skin it mostly just causes damage.”* So while a bit of sun is healthy, burning or daily strong sun on skin will age it (causing wrinkles, elastosis, and even systemic inflammation). He specifically advises protecting the face and neck from chronic sun to avoid looking old even if your insides are young. Sinclair uses sunscreens that are zinc- or titanium-based (physical blockers) to avoid some chemical sunscreen controversies. He also ensures he gets vitamin D via supplements during winter so he doesn’t have to risk too much sun.

- **EMF Exposure:** This is more speculative, but Sinclair has mentioned he reduces unnecessary exposure to electromagnetic fields (like he doesn’t keep his cell phone in his pocket all day, and he turns off Wi-Fi at night in his bedroom). The science here isn’t settled, but he errs on caution especially with his kids. He uses wired headphones or speakerphone more than holding the phone to his head for long calls. It’s a minor point, but illustrative of his preventative mindset.

- **Blue Zones Lifestyle Factors:** Sinclair often references the Blue Zones (regions with many centenarians). Besides diet (plant-heavy) and activity (natural movement), Blue Zones share lifestyle traits: strong family/community, low chronic stress, and moderate **daily activity integrated into life** (like gardening, walking, etc.). Sinclair has tried to adapt some of these: he took up a small home gardening project to grow herbs and veggies – a relaxing activity that also yields hormetic foods. He makes sure to schedule social time despite work (since community is a factor). Also, many Blue Zones involve a **slower pace of life** and more daily **moderate physical chores** – Sinclair’s life is hectic, but on weekends he intentionally slows down: he might do yard work, fix things around the house, or take unhurried walks with family – emulating some of that lifestyle.

- **Sexual Activity:** While not often discussed in detail, Sinclair did mention in one podcast episode that sexual health is an aspect of overall health. There’s data that regular sexual activity might correlate with longevity (perhaps through stress reduction, hormonal balance, etc.). He joked about covering “improving your sexual function” in a future episode ([The Science of Looking Younger, Longer | Episode 6 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/the-science-of-looking-younger-longer-episode-6/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)) ([The Science of Looking Younger, Longer | Episode 6 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/the-science-of-looking-younger-longer-episode-6/#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20true%2C%20especially%20the%20parts,I%20thought%20you%20were%20excited)). While that was a lighthearted moment, the underlying point is that maintaining healthy intimacy and hormone levels (testosterone in men, etc.) is part of healthy aging. Sinclair hasn’t publicly shared his regimen on this, but general advice is: if needed, address hormonal imbalances (some men consider testosterone replacement in older age, but Sinclair has not indicated he does this; he likely keeps his T levels healthy through exercise and perhaps supplements like vitamin D and zinc).

- **Posture and Ergonomics:** Sinclair spends a lot of time at a computer. He uses an ergonomic chair and sometimes a standing desk to avoid back problems. He’s conscious of posture – slouching can lead to neck and back pain, which can impair exercise and sleep. Longevity is also about mobility. He mentions doing some stretching (like yoga) to counteract tight hip flexors from sitting and to maintain flexibility.

- **Dental Care:** Interestingly, oral health is a somewhat unsung hero in longevity. Sinclair follows good dental hygiene – brushing, flossing, and getting regular cleanings. Chronic gum inflammation (periodontitis) has been linked to heart disease and even dementia (some studies found Alzheimer’s brains with oral bacteria). By preventing gum disease, one reduces a source of chronic inflammation. Sinclair likely flosses daily (he’s joked “floss like your life depends on it – because it might” in a talk). He may also use a water flosser and an electric toothbrush for thorough cleaning. This seems mundane but is actually a part of preventing systemic inflammation.

- **Hearing Protection:** A detail some longevity folks note: hearing loss in older age is linked to cognitive decline (less auditory input can reduce brain stimulation and social engagement). Years of loud music or noise can accelerate hearing loss. Sinclair, having attended many conferences and events, tries to protect his hearing – using earplugs in very loud environments (like concerts, airplanes) and not blasting headphones. Maintaining good hearing contributes to quality of life and possibly cognitive health.

- **Safer Driving and Accidents:** Sinclair once noted, with a bit of humor, that one of the best ways to increase odds of living long is **not to die in an accident.** So, he mentions common-sense but often overlooked things like wearing seatbelts, driving attentively, using helmets when biking – because an early accidental death obviously nullifies all other longevity efforts. So part of lifestyle is risk management. Sinclair isn’t an adrenaline junkie; he doesn’t do dangerous sports. He takes calculated risks in science, not in physical safety. 

- **Mental Engagement and Purpose (Reiterating):** Environmental also means intellectual environment. Sinclair surrounds himself with bright students and colleagues, fostering an intellectually stimulating environment that keeps him on his toes. He suggests others find communities or groups where they can continue to learn and be challenged – whether a book club, a workshop, volunteering, etc. It’s lifestyle in the broader sense – creating an environment that encourages growth, curiosity, and positivity.

In conclusion, **Sinclair’s lifestyle adjustments** go beyond diet and pills – they permeate how he lives day to day. He essentially tries to mimic a more “natural” human life in the modern world: aligning with day-night cycles, experiencing temperature changes, eating whole foods from rich soil, breathing clean air and drinking clean water, staying physically engaged, avoiding poisonous substances, and nurturing social bonds. These environmental and lifestyle factors may not be as headline-grabbing as a longevity drug, but Sinclair believes they compound to make a significant difference. They create the **context** in which all other interventions work best. As he might say, it’s about removing the negatives (pollution, poor light, chronic stress) and amplifying the positives (nature, rhythm, safe-yet-challenging surroundings). This holistic approach ensures that all aspects of life are oriented toward longevity.

## Epigenetics, Sirtuins, and Aging Clocks

One of Sinclair’s greatest contributions to aging science is in the realm of **epigenetics** – how gene activity (rather than gene sequence) changes with age – and the discovery of longevity genes like sirtuins. In his view, aging is primarily an epigenetic problem (the “software” corruption, as mentioned earlier). Here we summarize Sinclair’s key points on epigenetics, sirtuins, and measuring aging, translating them into actionable insights:

- **Sirtuins – Guardians of the Genome:** Sinclair discovered in the 1990s and 2000s that sirtuins (a family of NAD⁺-dependent enzymes) are activated by stress and help extend lifespan in yeast, worms, mice, and potentially humans ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=lot%20of%20people%20are%20interested,understand%20Sirtuin%20activation%20in%20yeast)) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=lot%20of%20people%20are%20interested,understand%20Sirtuin%20activation%20in%20yeast)). He often calls sirtuins **“the longevity gene circuit”**. There are 7 sirtuins in mammals (SIRT1-7) that govern processes from DNA repair to mitochondrial function to inflammation. Sinclair’s advice is all about activating sirtuins: through NAD boosters (NMN) and sirtuin-activating compounds (resveratrol, etc.), and through lifestyle (fasting, exercise). *“Sirtuins defend the body. They repair DNA, boost metabolic efficiency, and keep cells alive under stress,”* Sinclair explains ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=Well%2C%20they%E2%80%99re%20similar%20to%20what,that%20we%20had%20as%20the)). However, they require NAD⁺ to function, which is why NAD decline with age is such a problem. By age 50, NAD⁺ levels are about half of what they were at 20 (Sinclair, 2019). So one pillar of his approach is restoring NAD to **“fuel” the sirtuins** ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=David%20Sinclair%20)) ([NMN, NR, Resveratrol, Metformin & Other Longevity Molecules | Episode 4 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/nmn-nr-resveratrol-metformin-other-longevity-molecules-episode-4/#:~:text=Yeah%2C%20I%20take%20one%20gram,grams%20and%20triple%20the%20amount)). We’ve already covered how he does that (NMN, etc.). 

  Another way to boost sirtuins is **caloric restriction** – which increases NAD⁺ and directly stimulates SIRT1 via increased levels of certain activator proteins. Resveratrol in Sinclair’s research bound to SIRT1 and made it more active in the presence of NAD⁺. So think of sirtuins as soldiers that protect our genome – we need to both provide them ammo (NAD) and not distract them unnecessarily. Interestingly, sirtuins get “distracted” when they have to leave their gene-regulating posts to go repair DNA breaks. Over time, Sinclair’s lab found, after many DNA breaks (from radiation, etc.), sirtuins don’t all return to their original positions, leading to epigenetic chaos (genes on/off wrongly). This is the basis of his **Information Theory of Aging** ([David Sinclair Explains How Reversing Aging Is Possible: Neil deGrasse Tyson Interview ](https://www.nad.com/news/david-sinclair-explains-how-reversing-aging-is-possible-neil-degrasse-tyson-interview#:~:text=Excitingly%2C%20however%2C%20there%20may%20be,can%20activate%20to%20reverse%20aging)) ([David Sinclair Explains How Reversing Aging Is Possible: Neil deGrasse Tyson Interview ](https://www.nad.com/news/david-sinclair-explains-how-reversing-aging-is-possible-neil-degrasse-tyson-interview#:~:text=Excitingly%2C%20however%2C%20there%20may%20be,can%20activate%20to%20reverse%20aging)). Therefore, **protecting DNA and reducing DNA damage** can help sirtuins stay focused. That means avoiding smoking, excessive radiation, etc., which cause lots of breaks. It also suggests that therapies which help quickly recruit and release sirtuins from breaks (maybe NAD, maybe specific proteins like HR repair factors) could preserve epigenetic info.

- **AMPK and mTOR – the other longevity pathways:** While Sinclair often highlights sirtuins, he reminds that **AMPK** (activated by low energy states, metformin, exercise) and **mTOR** (inhibited by low amino acids, rapamycin, fasting) are two other key pathways ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=fasting,restrict%20calories%2C%20when%20we%20fast)) ([What to Eat & When to Eat for Longevity | Episode 2 | Lifespan with Dr. David Sinclair | PodScript](https://podscript.ai/podcasts/lifespan-with-dr-david-sinclair-podcast/what-to-eat-when-to-eat-for-longevity-episode-2/#:~:text=fasting,restrict%20calories%2C%20when%20we%20fast)). All three (AMPK, mTOR, sirtuins) sense different types of stress but converge on promoting healthspan extension when activated (or in the case of mTOR, inhibited). Sinclair’s regimen simultaneously addresses all three: 
  - Fasting & metformin activate AMPK.
  - Low protein periods & potential future use of rapamycin inhibit mTOR.
  - NAD boosters & polyphenols activate sirtuins.
  
  This comprehensive approach is basically a **“belt and suspenders”** method to ensure all longevity pathways are optimized. Sinclair suggests people familiarize themselves with these pathways because many future therapies will target them. For now, lifestyle can modulate all: e.g., high-intensity exercise activates AMPK strongly in muscle, fasting inhibits mTOR during the fast, etc. 

- **Epigenetic Clocks (Horvath Clock):** Steve Horvath’s epigenetic clock (from UCLA) is a formula using DNA methylation at many sites to predict biological age. Sinclair is very compelled by these clocks because they might measure the “information loss” he theorizes. When his team reprogrammed old mice eyes to be younger, they saw the epigenetic clock reverse significantly, validating that partial reprogramming truly made cells younger ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=DAS%3A%20The%20information%20theory%20of,to%20reinstall%20the%20software%20itself)) ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=DAS%3A%20The%20information%20theory%20of,to%20reinstall%20the%20software%20itself)). For individuals, taking an epigenetic age test can give a baseline. Sinclair likes them because you can run self-experiments: take a test, do an intervention for a year, test again to see if your aging rate slowed. A person might see, for example, going plant-based and doing more exercise slowed their epigenetic aging from say 1.0 “years per year” to 0.8 “years per year.” In fact, there are programs now where people achieved epigenetic age reversal through diet and lifestyle (e.g., a small study showed 2 years age reversal in 8 weeks with diet, supplements, and lifestyle). Sinclair thinks these clocks will become the gold standard of measuring efficacy of anti-aging interventions. 

  He personally tracks his epigenetic age (as mentioned, he’s ahead of calendar age). If it weren’t improving or was getting worse, he’d tweak his routine. So, his advice is: **consider measuring your biological age** via an epigenetic test (or a blood biomarker age algorithm, or a fitness age via VO2 max, etc.) – it’s a baseline to beat. Then, implement changes and aim to lower that biological age.

- **Gene Therapy for Age Reversal:** In the “future of aging therapies” (next section) we’ll discuss Yamanaka factors and such, but it ties in here: those therapies work via epigenetic reprogramming – essentially resetting the epigenome (the pattern of which genes are on/off) to a younger state. Sinclair’s lab used three factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 – abbreviated OSK) delivered by a virus into old mice’s eyes, which reversed vision loss ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=vision)) ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=Advertisement)). This is a partial reprogramming (excluding the factor c-Myc to avoid cancer risk). It reactivates youthful gene expression without fully dedifferentiating the cell to a stem cell. The exciting part: it not only fixed vision, it also seemed to **turn back the epigenetic clock** significantly, and even extended the life of mice in separate experiments ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=So%20now%20we%E2%80%99re%20at%20the,treated%20in%20August%20of%202025)) ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=So%20now%20we%E2%80%99re%20at%20the,treated%20in%20August%20of%202025)). Sinclair extrapolates that in the future, we might take **“Yamanaka factor gene therapy”** or perhaps pills that induce those factors temporarily, to reset our epigenome and literally make our cells younger. That’s not available yet, but his foundational research is aimed at enabling that.

  For now, the closest analog we have are lifestyle and supplements that modulate the epigenome more gently. For instance, exercise and diet can increase **TGF-beta** pathways that remodel epigenetics, or fasting can increase **Oct4** in certain contexts. But these are mild compared to actual reprogramming.

- **DNA Stability and Repair:** Epigenetics aside, **accumulated DNA damage** is still an issue (mutations, breaks). Sinclair’s stance is that if we keep epigenetic info intact, cells can repair DNA fairly well, but if a mutation happens in a critical gene (like a tumor suppressor), that’s a problem (cancer). So he does what he can to support DNA repair:
  - He takes NAD boosters (since PARP enzymes that repair DNA need NAD).
  - He ensures he gets enough micronutrients like zinc, magnesium, folate, B12, etc., which are co-factors for DNA repair enzymes or for making DNA (for example, folate and B12 ensure no uracil misincorporation into DNA).
  - He tries to avoid things that cause DNA breaks: e.g., he minimizes X-ray exposure (he doesn’t do unnecessary CT scans, and if at dentist, he asks for thyroid shield during X-rays). He’s aware airline travel increases cosmic radiation exposure; he still travels a lot but perhaps tries to mitigate with more antioxidants around those times or NAD to help repair.
  - In his lab, they are exploring molecules that boost the DNA repair pathway specifically (like **NAD+** and a compound called **piceatannol** which might activate SIRT6, a sirtuin that specifically helps repair telomeres and double-strand breaks). In the future, there may be **SIRT6 activator drugs** to reduce age-related DNA damage accumulation.

- **Telomeres:** Sinclair acknowledges telomere shortening as a hallmark of aging, but in his view it’s downstream of other processes – i.e., epigenetic changes and chronic inflammation hasten telomere loss. Nonetheless, maintaining telomeres is beneficial. Things like stress reduction have been shown to slow telomere shortening. High cortisol can shorten telomeres faster. On the flip side, exercise is linked to longer telomeres. So his lifestyle likely indirectly supports telomeres. If one were to try to lengthen telomeres, the only current therapy is telomerase activation (like TA-65, a supplement from astragalus). Sinclair hasn’t spoken much about TA-65; some peers use it, but evidence is mixed. He seems more focused on the epigenome than directly on telomeres, perhaps because telomerase activation bears a potential cancer risk if done indiscriminately (since telomere elongation can also immortalize cells). But he’s watching that space.

- **Methylation and Supplements:** Because epigenetic clocks measure DNA methylation, Sinclair ensures he has enough methyl donors (hence TMG supplementation) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=Dr,reducing%20methylation%20in%20the%20body)) ([David Sinclair Supplement Routine | 2024 Scientific Review](https://novoslabs.com/best-anti-aging-supplements-that-harvard-scientist-david-sinclair-takes/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaq0qOtdgO0kQGPMS6NLeQ1_aaYDmZ4zE00-U9Gnan98GXSQ5-#:~:text=NMN%20is%20used%20by%20cells,be%20secreted%20by%20the%20kidneys)). However, he doesn’t necessarily want *more* methylation (excess methylation of certain genes can be bad). It’s about balance: e.g., aging involves **hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes** (bad, because it silences them) and **hypomethylation of other areas** (leading to genomic instability). Fasting and exercise tend to normalize some of that – turning on tumor suppressors, etc. 

  There’s emerging advice from epigenetic clock researchers on diet to slow methylation aging: e.g., high in greens (folate), high in polyphenols (which can influence methylation), adequate choline (which supports methylation). Sinclair’s diet naturally covers that: lots of greens, avoids processed foods that might have DNA-damaging preservatives, etc.

- **One More Longevity Gene – FOXO3:** A gene called FOXO3 is strongly associated with centenarians (favorable variants give ~2x odds of longevity). FOXO3 is a transcription factor upregulated by stress, especially by AMPK activation and insulin signaling reduction. It triggers many antioxidant and repair genes. Sinclair’s regimen of fasting, metformin, and exercise likely increases FOXO3 activity. Though he doesn’t often mention FOXO3 by name, it’s part of the network. In one podcast he noted, *“There are genes like FOXO that control hundreds of other genes to defend the body”* – essentially these are master switches that his recommended practices flip on.

In practical terms, what does all this mean for someone seeking to leverage epigenetics for longevity? Sinclair would say:

- **Engage in interventions that preserve or restore youthful gene expression.** For now, that’s lifestyle (CR, exercise, etc.) and possibly supplements (NAD+, sirtuin activators).
- **Measure your biological age** to know if your epigenome is aging faster or slower than expected, and adjust accordingly.
- **Stay tuned to emerging therapies**: The next decade may bring partial reprogramming treatments and advanced gene therapies that can reset aging at the cellular level. Sinclair is at the cutting edge here – he even co-founded a company (Rejuvenate Bio and Life Biosciences) working on age-reversal gene therapies.
- **Support your longevity genes**: give them the inputs they need (NAD, proper nutrients) and the stimuli to activate (hormesis), and avoid things that derail them (constant overeating, high sugar, smoking – which create DNA damage and epigenetic noise).
- **Think of aging as an Information problem**: do what you can to maintain the “readability” of your genome. That includes stable daily cycles (circadian entrainment helps genes turn on/off at correct times), stable internal environment (avoid chronic high sugar or cortisol that cause aberrant gene expression), and boosting “youthful” signals (e.g., certain hormones or factors that decline – for instance, some look at young blood/plasma transfusions; Sinclair hasn’t done that but acknowledges the science from parabiosis showing young blood can rejuvenate older animals via epigenetic changes).

Sinclair often summarizes, *“We’ve figured out the causes of aging – now it’s about reversing them.”* Epigenetic change is, in his view, **the major cause**, and he’s demonstrated in animals that reversing epigenetic aging can reverse aging itself. Therefore, many of his recommendations ultimately aim to slow the rate of epigenetic change or even reverse some of it. The tools in our hands today (diet, exercise, supplements) can **slow the clock**. The tools coming (reprogramming, advanced gene therapy) may **turn back the clock** significantly. Until those arrive, his plan is to keep himself as biologically young as possible using everything discussed, so that he’s in good shape to take advantage of future breakthroughs. As he half-jokingly says, *“I’m trying to stay alive until the revolution (in aging reversal) comes.”*

## Future of Aging Therapies (Gene Therapies, Yamanaka Factors, etc.)

In this final section, we focus on Sinclair’s insights into the future – the next-generation therapies that he believes will transform aging from something we manage into something we can **truly reverse** or cure. Sinclair is not just a practitioner of current methods; he’s a pioneer pushing the envelope with bold research. Here are the key future therapies he often discusses and what he recommends in anticipation of them:

- **Epigenetic Reprogramming (Yamanaka Factors):** As mentioned, Sinclair’s lab showed that by delivering three of the four Yamanaka factors (OSK) to aged mice, they could reset cells to a younger state without losing cell identity ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=DAS%3A%20The%20information%20theory%20of,to%20reinstall%20the%20software%20itself)) ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=DAS%3A%20The%20information%20theory%20of,to%20reinstall%20the%20software%20itself)). This restored vision in old mice with glaucoma and improved their organs’ function ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=First%20of%20all%2C%20we%20showed,glaucoma%2C%20marked%20improvements%20in%20vision)) ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=vision)). Importantly, it also extended lifespan in proof-of-concept experiments ([Fifteen Questions: David Sinclair on Age Reversal, Exercise, and Immortal Yeast Cells | Magazine | The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/2/7/david-sinclair-fifteen-questions/#:~:text=So%20now%20we%E2%80%99re%20at%20the,treated%20in%20August%20of%202025)). Sinclair has called this result *“revolutionary”* – because it suggests aging is not permanent damage but rather a reversible state of gene expression. He often says, *“The backup copy of youth is still in our cells; we just need to find a way to access it”* (Sinclair, 2020). Reprogramming using OSK is the key to accessing that backup. 

  Looking ahead, Sinclair believes within the next **5-10 years** we may see clinical trials of epigenetic reprogramming in humans. The initial targets might be eye diseases (as in mice) or other localized issues. But eventually, systemic reprogramming to reverse aging in multiple organs could become feasible. **How would it be delivered?** Possibly via gene therapy vectors (like AAV viruses) that carry the reprogramming genes under a controllable switch (like a drug or antibiotic that can turn them on for a short period). In the StarTalk interview, Sinclair even said he envisions a day when one could get an **“age-resetting injection”** that in a matter of months turns a 70-year-old’s cells into those of a 40-year-old (Sinclair, 2024) ([David Sinclair Explains How Reversing Aging Is Possible: Neil deGrasse Tyson Interview ](https://www.nad.com/news/david-sinclair-explains-how-reversing-aging-is-possible-neil-degrasse-tyson-interview#:~:text=genes%2C%20leading%20to%20aging%20and,next%20five%20to%20six%20years)) ([David Sinclair Explains How Reversing Aging Is Possible: Neil deGrasse Tyson Interview ](https://www.nad.com/news/david-sinclair-explains-how-reversing-aging-is-possible-neil-degrasse-tyson-interview#:~:text=young%20again.%20,next%20five%20to%20six%20years)). It sounds like sci-fi, but his research is a proof of concept.

  For now, average people can’t do this at home. However, Sinclair advises staying **informed and involved**: support aging research, perhaps participate in trials when they come, and in the meantime do everything to keep yourself healthy (so that you’re a good candidate for these therapies later). Essentially, **“live long enough to live forever”** – or at least to benefit from the radical life-extension tools in development. Sinclair often shares news of breakthroughs and has hinted that his lab is working on making the reprogramming even safer and more targeted.

- **Gene Therapies & CRISPR:** Beyond reprogramming, gene therapy could be used to bolster the body in other ways. For example, delivering copies of **protective genes** that some people naturally have. Sinclair notes a few genes from human populations that correlate with longevity:
  - **APOE2 or APOE3 Christchurch variant** – variants associated with longer life and cognitive protection.
  - **Sirt6 super-active variant** – in centenarians, some have a more active SIRT6 enzyme (which repairs DNA). Hypothetically, one could deliver a gene therapy for a more active SIRT6 in everyone.
  - **FoXO3 variant** – same idea.
  - Genes that confer disease resistance (like certain LRP or PCSK9 variants that keep cholesterol low).
  
  In theory, CRISPR could precisely edit one’s genome to include these longevity variants. Sinclair’s excitement about CRISPR is tempered by the fact that doing systemic gene edits in adults is still tricky (most success has been in editing blood cells or liver cells via infusion). But he thinks future gene therapy or mRNA therapy could allow “turning on” embryonic genes that we lose with age. For instance, **hTERT (telomerase)** – delivering telomerase gene to extend telomeres. Trials in mice show it can increase lifespan without huge cancer risk if done carefully. A gene therapy company (Libella) even briefly offered telomerase gene therapy in Colombia, though it’s unproven.

  **Sinclair’s recommendation:** *Support and follow gene therapy research.* If you have a serious age-related disease, consider clinical trials that involve gene therapy. For instance, there are trials of AAV delivering APOE2 to APOE4 Alzheimer’s patients. Or myostatin gene inhibitors to boost muscle in frailty. These are early but could become real options by 2030. Sinclair’s own company might bring an OSK gene therapy to clinic for glaucoma in the next few years if all goes well.

- **NAD+ Precursors as Medicines:** While NAD boosters are supplements now, Sinclair predicts they may become regulated medicines for specific conditions of aging (e.g., an NMN-derived drug for neurodegeneration or heart failure). He co-founded MetroBiotech, which is working on a proprietary NAD booster (likely a more drug-like version of NMN or a prodrug). In a 2022 update, he said they’re in human trials and it’s looking promising for certain conditions. So in the future, your doctor might prescribe a high-grade NAD booster to treat aging-related ills, with FDA approval. Sinclair’s guidance: *when these drugs come, don’t be afraid of them just because they target aging.* They will be vetted for safety. If you’re older by then, they could help you considerably. Already, NAD boosters are being trialed for safety in various doses.

- **Senolytic Therapies:** These are drugs or interventions to remove senescent cells (damaged cells that linger and cause inflammation). Sinclair has spoken about senolytics like **Dasatinib+Quercetin** or new ones in development (UBX, Unity Biotechnology’s compounds, etc.). While his own focus is more on epigenetic reprogramming, he acknowledges senolytics might become part of an anti-aging cocktail. Imagine at age 60 you do a round of senolytic treatments to clear out senescent cells, then a reprogramming therapy to reset the remaining cells, etc. Senolytics are already in human trials for things like osteoarthritis (Unity’s UBX0101, though that had mixed results) and diabetic kidney disease. 

  Sinclair’s practical tip now is: naturally encourage senescent cell clearance by fasting (prolonged fasting can prompt old cells to die off and stem cells to activate) and exercise (which can reduce pro-inflammatory senescent cell burden in fat). But soon, a pill may help. He’s also mentioned **Fisetin**, a flavonoid, which at high doses can act senolytically. Some people do a “Fisetin cleanse” – e.g., 20 mg/kg for 2 days in a month. Sinclair hasn’t publicly endorsed that regimen, but he notes studies in mice where high-dose fisetin extended lifespan via senolytic effect.

- **Stem Cell and Regenerative Therapies:** Sinclair foresees using stem cells to replace worn-out tissues (like new cartilage for joints, or new neurons, etc.). However, he thinks if we can reprogram in vivo, we might not need to inject new stem cells from outside; our own cells will rejuvenate and produce what’s needed. Still, for certain things like **thymus regeneration** (the thymus shrinks with age, hurting immunity), cell therapy or tissue engineering may be required. He’s mentioned interest in **plasma exchange** or parabiosis-inspired therapies (giving factors from young blood without the need for actual blood exchange). A human trial called E5 is testing a plasma fraction that seemingly rejuvenated old rats. Sinclair keeps an eye on these, as they might come to fruition sooner. He even speculated that some factor in young blood might be as powerful as OSK gene therapy in resetting epigenetics, though that’s unknown.

- **Organ Replacement and Bioprinting:** For longevity to reach radical levels, people may need new organs as backups if their originals are too damaged. Sinclair notes advances in growing organs from induced pluripotent stem cells or using animals (e.g., recent pig heart into human transplant). He quips that eventually we might have **organ banks** or the ability to print a new kidney if needed. That would take the fear out of organ failure in old age. However, if we succeed in true age reversal at cellular level, organs may repair themselves. Still, in transitional decades, regenerative medicine is crucial.

- **Longevity Drug Cocktails:** Sinclair often discusses the idea of a **polypill for aging** – a combination of drugs/supplements targeting different hallmarks. It might include: a senolytic, a NAD booster, a rapamycin analog (to inhibit mTOR), maybe a low-dose steroid or hormone balancer, etc. The TAME trial with metformin is the first stepping stone (if metformin shows broad benefits in humans, FDA might consider aging an indication). After that, combination trials could happen. By 2030s, Sinclair imagines doctors prescribing a suite of medications as standard for 50+ year-olds to slow aging. These could extend healthy life by maybe 10-20 years. But his bigger goal is more dramatic reversals with gene therapy as above.

- **Personalized Aging Reversal:** Because Sinclair sits at the intersection of tech and biology, he predicts AI and big data will play a role – analyzing your genome, epigenome, microbiome, etc., to tailor therapies (like exactly which genes to edit or which factor you individually lack). He advises people to keep records of their health data now, as it might feed into future AI models that give recommendations. 

- **Ethical and Social Considerations:** Sinclair also talks about how society needs to prepare for these advancements – from retirement planning to healthcare costs, etc. He strongly refutes the idea that longer lives will necessarily cause overpopulation or boredom; instead, he argues people will remain healthier and contribute to society longer, potentially reducing healthcare burdens. He’s started conversations with regulatory bodies to eventually classify “aging” as a treatable condition. *“We need to get the FDA on board that aging can be an endpoint for a clinical trial,”* he says (Sinclair, 2021). If that happens, big pharma and governments might invest heavily, accelerating progress.

**So what does Sinclair recommend individuals do now, given these horizon technologies?** Essentially: **“Hang in there.”** Continue practicing all the healthy behaviors to maximize your healthspan with current tools, because **the longer you live in good health now, the more likely you’ll reach the inflection point where aging becomes reversible.** He often uses the term **Longevity Escape Velocity**, popularized by others, meaning reaching a point where for every year you’re alive, science extends your potential lifespan by more than a year. We’re not there yet, but Sinclair thinks we might be within a couple decades of that threshold.

He also encourages supporting aging research: donate to or invest in longevity biotech companies, advocate for research funding, perhaps volunteer in a study. He notes that many promising therapies languish due to lack of funding or public interest. Changing the narrative – that aging is not inevitable and that treating it is a worthy goal – has been one of his missions (hence writing *Lifespan* for a general audience).

Finally, Sinclair emphasizes **hope**. He’s very optimistic that his generation (he’s in his 50s) and certainly his children’s generation will benefit from age-reversal therapies. He sometimes teases that he wouldn’t be surprised if lifespans of **120-150 years** become attainable, with most of those years lived in good health, not frailty. It’s not immortality, but it’s a doubling of healthy life compared to today. The combination of prevention (lifestyle, supplements) and intervention (gene therapy, etc.) could get us there. And if people remain vigorous at 100+, who knows what further breakthroughs they’ll see.

In sum, Sinclair’s vision of the future of aging is **extremely hopeful and proactive**. He doesn’t see a fixed limit to lifespan; he sees aging as a challenge that human ingenuity is starting to solve. For now, he advises practicing the best of what we know (everything covered in earlier sections) – these likely will also make any future therapy more effective (a fit 70-year-old will respond better to rejuvenation than a sick 70-year-old). As he often closes, *“It’s an exciting time to be alive… and if we do it right, it’s going to be a lot longer and healthier time to be alive as well.”* (Sinclair, 2019).

---

**Conclusion:** Dr. David Sinclair’s body of work has fundamentally changed how we think about aging – from an unavoidable decline to a process we can control, measure, and even reverse. His personal regimen reflects the state-of-the-art understanding of longevity science: leverage hormesis (fasting, exercise, temperature stresses), take targeted supplements (NMN, resveratrol, etc.), eat for metabolic health (low sugar, plant-heavy), track your biomarkers, and maintain mental resilience. By following these principles, Sinclair has markedly slowed his own aging, with biomarkers and biological age to prove it. More importantly, he has lit a path that countless others are now following.

The recommendations detailed in this report – **directly from Sinclair’s research and public communications** – serve as a comprehensive guide to living longer and healthier. They bridge pragmatic day-to-day habits and cutting-edge science. As Sinclair often reminds us, we are the first generation to have such knowledge at our disposal. While we await future breakthroughs like age-reversing gene therapies, there is a tremendous amount we can do *today* to extend our healthy years. The choices we make each day – when to eat, how to move, what to take, how to handle stress – literally affect the switches in our cells that determine our rate of aging.

In Dr. Sinclair’s vision, **growing older does not have to mean growing frail or ill.** We can be in our 80s, 90s, and beyond and still be active, sharp, and youthful – if we engage the body’s amazing survival systems. The science backs this up, and it’s advancing rapidly. By implementing Sinclair’s longevity strategies, we put ourselves in the best position to benefit from this revolution in aging. We may not just add years to our life, but life to our years – fulfilling the promise of healthspan even as lifespan increases.

As he writes in *Lifespan*, *“There is no biological law that says we must age”* ([Q&A: How David Sinclair is Fighting Aging—and How You Can, Too](https://blog.insidetracker.com/david-sinclair-fighting-aging-lifespan#:~:text=People%20tend%20to%20think%20of,How%20do%20you%20define%20it)) ([Q&A: How David Sinclair is Fighting Aging—and How You Can, Too](https://blog.insidetracker.com/david-sinclair-fighting-aging-lifespan#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAs%20a%20scientific%20definition%2C%20I%27m,%E2%80%9D)). Aging is a modifiable condition, and we have at our fingertips the tools to modulate it. Dr. David Sinclair’s advice, thoroughly compiled here, provides a blueprint for anyone who wants to seize control of their aging and ride the wave of scientific progress toward a longer, healthier future.
