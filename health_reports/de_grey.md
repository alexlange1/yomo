# Aubrey de Grey’s Strategies for Longevity: Current Recommendations

## Introduction  
Aubrey de Grey is a prominent biomedical gerontologist known for his pioneering work on aging and longevity. In recent years, de Grey has continually emphasized that the **key to living a long and healthy life** involves a combination of common-sense lifestyle choices and emerging medical therapies. He cautions against overhyped or one-size-fits-all solutions, instead advocating **prudent, personalized practices** that keep the body healthy while science works toward deeper rejuvenation breakthroughs. This report compiles **de Grey’s present-day beliefs** and explicit recommendations – drawn from his latest interviews, publications, and talks – on how to maximize healthy lifespan. Each section below covers a major domain of longevity (diet, supplements, exercise, diagnostics, therapies, and lifestyle mindset) and distills de Grey’s **current views** in clear, non-technical language. All statements are supported by **citations to de Grey’s own words or writings**, ensuring that interpretations accurately reflect his endorsed practices.

## Dietary Practices for Longevity  
### Eating Normally and Listening to Your Body  
One of de Grey’s most striking dietary recommendations is **to eat a normal, balanced diet guided by your body’s needs**, rather than following extreme or faddish diets. He has stated that he “eats normally” and does not adhere to any strict or specialized diet regimen [Big Think Interview](https://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-aubrey-de-grey/). The rationale is that if an individual’s health indicators are already good, **radical dietary changes may offer little benefit and could even backfire**. De Grey notes that his own body weight and composition are excellent, and his blood biomarkers are “extremely good in every way,” so “it would not make sense for me to try to make what’s already very good even better” through speculative diets or supplements [Big Think Interview](https://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-aubrey-de-grey/). In other words, **“if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”** He advises paying close attention to how your body responds to your current diet and only making adjustments if there are clear signs of trouble or deficiencies.

- **Avoiding Over-Generalization:** De Grey cautions against blindly adopting a diet just because it’s touted as healthy for everyone. He points out that human metabolism is **extraordinarily complex and individualized**, so the “worst thing we could do is over-generalize” dietary advice that might not suit a particular person’s unique biology [Big Think Interview](https://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-aubrey-de-grey/). Instead of forcing one’s eating habits into a rigid template, he suggests observing one’s own health metrics and well-being. For someone who is maintaining a healthy weight, has good blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and feels well, **a normal balanced diet (with appropriate portions and nutrients) is deemed sufficient**. In de Grey’s case, he does not eliminate entire food groups nor follow trends like ketogenic diets or veganism – he eats a regular diet and lets his stable health markers be his guide.

- **Moderation Over Extremes:** Current beliefs from de Grey emphasize moderation. He is not a proponent of severe caloric restriction or ultra-low-fat/carbohydrate extremes for the general population. Rather than aiming for any “miracle” superfoods or punishing fasting regimens, **he endorses a sensible intake of diverse foods to meet nutritional needs**. The goal is to avoid both overindulgence (which can lead to obesity or metabolic issues) and excessive restriction (which can cause malnutrition or stress). By **avoiding overeating**, especially of unhealthy processed foods and sugars, one can prevent age-accelerating problems like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. But beyond that, de Grey does not believe fine-tuning every macronutrient or consuming exotic diets will greatly impact maximum lifespan. The **focus is on not doing anything obviously harmful with diet**, and otherwise eating in a way that keeps you feeling healthy and energetic.

### Fasting and Caloric Restriction – Marginal Gains  
Aubrey de Grey acknowledges the significant scientific interest in caloric restriction (CR) and fasting for lifespan extension, but he interprets the data as **showing only marginal gains for humans**. Studies in shorter-lived species have demonstrated dramatic lifespan increases from severe calorie reduction, but de Grey emphasizes a crucial nuance: **the longer the natural lifespan of a species, the smaller the benefit from calorie restriction** tends to be [Mark Sackler Interview](https://seekingdelphi.com/category/age-of-robots/). For example, in simple organisms like worms you can quintuple lifespan through dietary restriction, yet in mice the maximum lifespan extension is roughly 50%, and in dogs it’s around 10% [Mark Sackler Interview](https://seekingdelphi.com/category/age-of-robots/). In long-lived primates like monkeys, decades-long CR studies have shown **at best only a few percent increase in lifespan**, with some studies showing no significant extension at all. Extrapolating from this trend, de Grey states **the prognosis for humans seeing major lifespan extension from calorie restriction is not very good** – it might only yield an extra couple of years of life at most.

- **Periodic Fasting as a Healthy Practice:** De Grey does agree that intermittent or periodic fasting can have health benefits, such as improving metabolic markers and possibly lowering cancer risk. He calls fasting “undoubtedly healthy,” particularly for its effects on metabolic fitness and perhaps on slowing early tumor growth. Short-term fasts or time-restricted feeding may mimic some of the cellular stress responses that benefit health. However, he believes the **lifespan gains from fasting are likely modest** – “only 1–2 years (at most)” for humans. In his view, fasting is **worthwhile for healthspan (keeping one healthier longer)**, but it is not a miracle that will dramatically delay aging. Therefore, people can practice fasting if they find it helps them **feel healthier or control weight**, but they should do so in moderation and not expect it to make them live decades longer than they otherwise would.

- **Calorie Restriction Mimetics:** There is considerable interest in drugs and compounds that mimic the effects of calorie restriction without actual fasting. De Grey notes that many purported longevity supplements – such as **metformin, rapamycin, and NAD⁺ boosters** – are basically hypothesized to act as “calorie restriction mimetics,” tricking the body’s cells into a metabolic state similar to that of fasting [Mark Sackler Interview](https://seekingdelphi.com/category/age-of-robots/). He finds this research valuable and is “all for this work” insofar as it may help people **stay healthy a bit longer** [Mark Sackler Interview](https://seekingdelphi.com/category/age-of-robots/). But he stresses a **“huge catch”**: because calorie restriction itself has a limited effect in long-lived species, any mimetic drug is inherently capped by that same limitation. In other words, even if a pill can safely simulate fasting, humans should not assume it will **radically extend lifespan**. De Grey supports exploring CR mimetics for their potential to improve late-life health, but he urges keeping expectations realistic – these are *adjuncts* to healthy living, not solutions to aging.

### Nutrition and Weight Management  
While de Grey doesn’t promote a specific diet, he implicitly endorses the **standard pillars of good nutrition**: adequate protein for muscle maintenance, plenty of vegetables and fiber for micronutrients, and not over-consuming junk foods or excessive calories. In discussions about centenarians and health, he has observed that **some long-lived individuals even have habits like being slightly overweight or eating indulgently**, indicating there is no single “longevity diet” that guarantees reaching 100 years old [Joe Rogan Podcast](https://ogjre.com/clip/aubrey-de-grey-centenarians-have-one-thing-in-common). The common thread he identifies is not a particular food but rather **resilience to stress (both metabolic and psychological)** – people who manage to avoid chronic metabolic stress (e.g. by not developing diabetes or atherosclerosis through poor diet) fare better in aging. 

- **Maintain a Healthy Body Composition:** De Grey frequently references that he keeps an eye on his weight and body composition. He notes with pride that he does not “put on any weight” easily and that his body composition is very good for his age [Big Think Interview](https://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-aubrey-de-grey/). For the general public, **avoiding obesity and significant visceral fat accumulation is an important practical longevity strategy**. Excess body fat, especially around the organs, promotes inflammation and accelerates diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and even dementia. De Grey’s example of eating normally but staying lean underscores that **caloric balance (not consistently overeating) is key**. He essentially recommends **eating enough to sustain energy and nutrition, but not so much that one gains unhealthy weight**. Regularly checking one’s weight or waistline and adjusting food intake accordingly is a simple practice to preserve long-term health.

- **Adequate Protein and Micronutrients:** Though he doesn’t specify macronutrient ratios, de Grey would likely agree that older adults should ensure adequate protein intake to prevent sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss), which is a significant factor in frailty. A balanced diet with a variety of fruits and vegetables provides antioxidants and vitamins that support the body’s repair mechanisms. There is no indication that he endorses high-dose vitamin supplements for general use (in fact, he personally avoids supplements), but **getting nutrients from whole foods is implicitly part of “eating normally.”** Thus, a person following de Grey’s advice would **focus on wholesome, varied foods** – for example, lean proteins, leafy greens, some fruit, whole grains, and healthy fats – to cover their nutritional bases without extremes. This common-sense nutrition helps maintain robust health, thereby **buying time for more definitive anti-aging interventions to arrive**.

## Supplementation and Pharmaceuticals  
### Minimal Personal Use of Supplements  
Aubrey de Grey is notably **conservative about taking supplements or medications for longevity**. He himself does *not* take any daily anti-aging supplements, as he has repeatedly stated in interviews. When asked if he uses supplements or special drugs to extend his life, his answer has been a firm **“No” – he takes nothing beyond what might be medically necessary** [Reddit AMA Interview](https://www.reddit.com/r/longevity/comments/1b5wboo/we_have_a_50_chance_of_reaching_longevity_escape/). This isn’t because he dismisses all supplements as useless; rather, it’s because he currently enjoys excellent health and believes adding extra pills could upset that balance. De Grey describes himself as “privileged to have a biological age much younger than my chronological age,” so he feels the **wisest course is to stick with what his body knows and avoid unnecessary interventions** [Reddit AMA Interview](https://www.reddit.com/r/longevity/comments/1b5wboo/we_have_a_50_chance_of_reaching_longevity_escape/). In short, he doesn’t see a need to experiment on himself with supplements when standard healthy living is keeping him in great shape.

- **Supplements Are Not a Panacea:** De Grey often addresses the popular notion that taking a cocktail of supplements can significantly slow aging. He urges caution here, highlighting that **many over-the-counter pills have only mild effects, if any, on the aging process**. For instance, antioxidants like vitamins C and E were once hyped for anti-aging, but clinical evidence hasn’t shown dramatic benefits in extending life or preventing age-related diseases when taken in supplement form. De Grey’s lack of supplement use underscores his stance that **no current supplement has proven robust longevity effects in humans** that would justify a blanket recommendation. He prefers to rely on a good diet to obtain necessary vitamins and minerals, rather than high-dose supplements. In his words, sticking to what works (normal food and lifestyle) is safer than “risking making it worse through things we don’t know” [Big Think Interview](https://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-aubrey-de-grey/). Unless a person has a diagnosed deficiency (like vitamin D or B12 deficiency, for example), de Grey would likely suggest **focusing on diet and exercise rather than pills**.

- **Context of Use – If It’s Not Broke:** It’s important to note de Grey’s nuance: his skepticism toward supplements is strongest in the context of a person who is already doing well health-wise. He acknowledges that **some people who have drawn “short straws” genetically or have specific age-related issues might benefit from targeted supplements or medications** [Big Think Interview](https://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-aubrey-de-grey/). For example, an elderly individual with early macular degeneration might be advised by doctors to take AREDS vitamin supplements for eye health, and de Grey would not oppose evidence-based use in that scenario. His main point is that **for an average healthy person, loading up on trendy anti-aging supplements is unlikely to yield significant benefits** and could even cause harm or unnecessary expense. Therefore, he personally avoids them and often suggests others should be similarly wary of any pill that claims to “guarantee” longer life.

### Promising Pharmaceuticals Under Study  
While de Grey doesn’t personally medicate himself for longevity, he is actively interested in the development of **pharmaceutical interventions that could slow aspects of aging**. He keeps an eye on clinical trials and experimental drugs that may become part of the longevity toolbox. However, his enthusiasm is tempered by realism about their limitations:

- **Metformin:** This common diabetes drug has been spotlighted for its potential anti-aging effects. The **TAME trial (Targeting Aging with Metformin)** is a large study testing whether metformin can delay the onset of age-related diseases in non-diabetic older adults. Aubrey de Grey’s view on metformin is that it is a rather **“weak treatment with a small effect size on lifespan”**. The data supporting metformin’s longevity benefit mostly come from retrospective studies in diabetics, and even then the effect (a few extra years of life) is modest. Moreover, metformin can have side effects (like gastrointestinal issues or lactic acidosis risk in some cases) that might outweigh marginal benefits. De Grey sees the value in the TAME trial not so much for metformin itself, but as a way to **convince regulators to treat aging as an indication** for drug approval. In summary, he does not discourage people from taking metformin if prescribed for a condition like diabetes or if they’re fully informed and willing (some longevity enthusiasts without diabetes do take metformin), but he does not actively endorse it as a reliable life-extender for healthy folks. It’s an interesting scientific exploration, in his eyes, but **not a game-changer for longevity**.

- **Rapamycin:** Rapamycin (and related mTOR inhibitors) is another drug of interest. It has extended lifespan in mice and is being tried in pet dogs for longevity. De Grey agrees rapamycin is worth studying – it’s often considered a stronger intervention than metformin – but he groups it similarly as a caloric restriction mimetic with diminishing returns in longer-lived species [Mark Sackler Interview](https://seekingdelphi.com/category/age-of-robots/). Rapamycin might improve healthspan by enhancing autophagy (cellular cleanup processes) and has shown the ability to rejuvenate aspects of aging immune function. Still, **de Grey remains “downbeat” about rapamycin’s ability to produce major lifespan gains in humans** [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7i9vrj/this_is_aubrey_im_starting_the_ama_now_and_i/). In a public Q&A, he noted that while compounds like metformin and rapamycin are exciting to many, he “[doesn’t] think these have what it takes to pass muster in a clinical trial” for real anti-aging effects in humans. In practical terms, some longevity physicians prescribe low-dose rapamycin intermittently for older patients to possibly reduce cancer and heart disease risk – de Grey wouldn’t say this is harmful, but he would caution that **we shouldn’t expect rapamycin to make 90-year-olds live to 120**. Its impact might be a modest increase in healthy years, akin to the effects of caloric restriction.

- **NAD⁺ Boosters (e.g., NR/NMN):** In the supplement realm, molecules like nicotinamide riboside (NR) or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) have gained popularity for boosting NAD⁺ levels, a coenzyme that declines with age. NAD⁺ is important for cell energy and DNA repair, and researchers like David Sinclair have reported health improvements in animals from NAD⁺ precursors. Aubrey de Grey has noted that “NAD+ supplements are all the rage right now” [Mark Sackler Interview](https://seekingdelphi.com/category/age-of-robots/), but he maintains a scientific skepticism. These supplements again often act via mild **hormetic stress or CR-mimicking pathways**. To date, there’s no conclusive human evidence that NAD⁺ boosters extend lifespan or strongly prevent diseases; they may improve some metabolic markers. De Grey’s stance would be that **it’s fine for research to continue and for interested individuals to try them (with the caveat that regulatory status of NMN is in flux)**, but he does not count NAD⁺ boosters as proven longevity therapeutics. He likely views them as another piece of the puzzle – potentially useful for improving “healthspan” – but not as **substitutes for the comprehensive damage-repair therapies** he believes are needed to truly defeat aging.

- **Senolytics (Dasatinib & Quercetin, etc.):** A very promising class of pharmaceuticals that de Grey is excited about is **senolytic drugs**, which specifically kill senescent cells (cells that have deteriorated and contribute to aging). One example is the combination of the leukemia drug dasatinib with the plant flavonoid quercetin, which in animal studies can selectively clear senescent cells and rejuvenate tissues. De Grey has highlighted that senolytic treatments exemplify the kind of rejuvenation biotechnologies his SENS approach predicted: they address a root cause of aging (accumulated senescent cells) by removing it. In mice, senolytics have produced “very impressive results” across a range of age-related conditions, often restoring functions of older animals to a more youthful state after the senescent cells are purged. Notably, de Grey said it was a “big surprise” to scientists that **even starting a senolytic therapy late in a mouse’s life could extend its remaining lifespan significantly**. This suggests that senolytics don’t just prevent damage – they can actively reverse some aspects of aging. As of today, a few senolytic agents are in early human trials (for example, testing dasatinib/quercetin in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and potentially osteoarthritis). De Grey’s view is that senolytics are one of the first real rejuvenation therapies to reach the clinic, and he anticipates their benefits will become so clear that off-label usage in aging humans will grow in the near future. While he might not personally be taking senolytics yet (due to his conservative self-experimentation stance), he **endorses the idea that clearing senescent cells is a highly valuable intervention**. In practical terms, within a few years there may be doctor-prescribed or even over-the-counter senolytic treatments for middle-aged and older individuals to periodically “clean out” senescent cells and improve tissue function. De Grey would likely advise people to pay attention to this field and consider such therapies when they become proven and safe.

### Perspective on Anti-Aging Drugs vs. Rejuvenation  
Aubrey de Grey consistently emphasizes that **no single supplement or drug available today will stop aging**. At best, current pharmaceuticals can **buy a bit of extra healthy time** by targeting one aspect of aging. For instance, metformin might modestly lower cancer and heart disease rates via improved metabolic health, or senolytics might reduce inflammation and improve organ function by removing senescent cells. However, aging is a multifaceted process – “a diverse collection of damages” – and de Grey argues that **truly significant lifespan extension will require addressing all those damages in parallel**. Therefore, he frames supplements and drugs as **short-term partial measures**: they are worth pursuing (especially for individuals who are at risk or already experiencing aging issues), but they are *not* the ultimate solution.

- **“Help People Stay Healthy Longer”:** De Grey’s endorsement of current anti-aging compounds is conditional. He says he’s supportive of anything that helps people stay healthier longer into old age [Mark Sackler Interview](https://seekingdelphi.com/category/age-of-robots/). If someone wants to take a safe, well-studied drug like metformin because their doctor thinks it might improve their healthspan, de Grey finds that “valuable.” The important caveat he adds is that one must not become complacent or overly optimistic that these measures alone will let us escape aging. **They are holding actions, not escape velocity.** For example, a 70-year-old on a combination of metformin, rapamycin, and senolytics might statistically have a lower biological age than a 70-year-old without those interventions – perhaps functioning more like a 65-year-old. That’s beneficial and could buy a few years of life. But without the advent of more powerful rejuvenation biotechnologies, that person will still eventually succumb to the accumulating damage that no current pill can fully prevent. De Grey’s work is focused on bringing about those more powerful therapies.

- **Avoiding False Security:** Because he is so steeped in the science, de Grey is aware of the **“snake oil” history in anti-aging medicine**. He warns against overhyping supplements in a way that recalls the fraudulent “anti-aging” products of past decades. His concept of the “pro-aging trance” (the psychological complacency about aging’s inevitability) even extends to how people sometimes rationalize taking a few supplements and then ignoring other important health factors. He would say: don’t fall into a trap of thinking *just* taking the latest pill (be it NAD⁺ boosters, resveratrol, turmeric, etc.) is enough. **A comprehensive approach is needed**, and the field must keep pushing for true rejuvenation therapies. For now, maintaining one’s health with basic measures and perhaps some carefully chosen pharmacological aid is the best strategy.

In summary, **de Grey’s current stance on supplements and drugs** is practical and evidence-based. He personally uses none for longevity, but acknowledges some can have value for health maintenance. His overarching advice is to **manage expectations**, use interventions that have a solid medical rationale (preferably under physician guidance), and always keep an eye on the horizon for more definitive treatments that repair aging damage rather than just slow it down.

## Exercise and Physical Activity  
### “Whatever Exercise Seems Appropriate” – The Middle Road  
Unlike many health gurus who prescribe intensive exercise routines, Aubrey de Grey’s approach to physical activity is notably moderate. He has said that he only does **“whatever exercise seems appropriate for me”** – nothing extreme, just enough to keep in shape [Big Think Interview](https://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-aubrey-de-grey/). For him, this has been sufficient to maintain a healthy body composition and excellent biomarkers, as he naturally stays fit and doesn’t gain weight easily. The lesson he imparts is that exercise should be **tailored to the individual**. If you feel healthy and your body is in good condition with a certain routine (even if it’s just regular walking and occasional sports), that may be “appropriate” for you and you don’t need to force yourself into a marathon-running or heavy weightlifting program. On the other hand, if a person is sedentary and starting to accumulate health issues, then **ramping up physical activity is definitely appropriate** for them to improve cardiovascular fitness, strength, and metabolic health. 

- **Health Benefits Over Performance:** De Grey’s view on exercise focuses on health metrics, not athletic performance. He is not concerned with how fast one can run or how much one can bench press, but rather with maintaining **functional fitness and preventing disease**. Moderate exercise such as **brisk walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, or any enjoyable physical activity** can dramatically reduce the risk of age-related conditions. It improves heart health, lowers blood pressure, enhances insulin sensitivity, and helps maintain muscle mass and bone density. De Grey recognizes these benefits – indeed, exercise is one of the “simple practices” that he agrees can make some difference for longevity ([Aubrey de Grey on Ending Aging and the Relative Merits of Various Approaches – Fight Aging!](https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2018/01/aubrey-de-grey-on-ending-aging-and-the-relative-merits-of-various-approaches/#:~:text=Do%20you%20want%20to%20live,out%20how%20to%20help%20%C2%BB)). However, he also notes that beyond a certain point, more exercise doesn’t necessarily equate to more longevity. There are diminishing returns and even risks (e.g., overtraining injuries). Thus, he advocates **regular, moderate exercise** as part of a longevity lifestyle, while warning against both extremes of too little or excessively strenuous exercise.

- **Avoiding Sedentary Lifestyle:** While de Grey might not hit the gym for hours, he certainly doesn’t live idly. A key recommendation implicit in his lifestyle is to **avoid prolonged sedentary behavior**. He travels often for work, which means he’s on his feet and moving through airports, conferences, labs, etc. For an average person, the take-home point would be: **incorporate movement into your daily life.** If you have a desk job, get up and stretch frequently, take stairs when possible, and ensure you have some exercise routine on most days (even a 30-minute walk or some gardening counts). Physical activity keeps the body’s systems humming – circulation improves, muscles stay conditioned, and even brain health benefits (exercise can spur growth factors beneficial for the brain). De Grey doesn’t list a regimen, but one could imagine his advice being akin to public health guidelines: aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week (or 75 minutes of vigorous activity), plus some strength exercises for major muscle groups a couple of times weekly. What’s crucial is consistency: doing something active regularly, as opposed to long periods of inactivity punctuated by occasional extreme workouts.

### Strength and Muscle Maintenance  
Although de Grey doesn’t explicitly talk about lifting weights or bodybuilding, one of the challenges of aging he often cites is **sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass)**, which contributes to frailty. Therefore, maintaining muscle through one’s activities is important. This doesn’t mean everyone must pump iron at the gym – functional strength can be preserved through daily activities, bodyweight exercises, or light resistance training. A 70-year-old doesn’t need to deadlift heavy barbells to get longevity benefits; even simple resistance band workouts or carrying groceries can help maintain strength. De Grey’s principle of “do what is appropriate for you” applies here: **if you’re young and able, building a reserve of muscle and strength could be beneficial for later years** (it gives you more buffer before frailty sets in). If you’re older or not inclined to formal exercise, then ensure you at least stay active in ways that challenge your muscles a bit – like taking stairs, doing yard work, yoga, or playing with grandchildren. 

- **Flexibility and Balance:** In addition to aerobic and strength, de Grey would likely appreciate the often overlooked aspects of fitness: flexibility, balance, and agility. These are crucial for preventing falls and injuries in older age. Gentle activities like stretching, yoga, or tai chi can be incorporated to maintain joint mobility and balance. While he hasn’t spoken about these specifically, they align with the goal of keeping the body functional and robust against the challenges of aging. A person following de Grey’s guidance might include a stretching routine or balance practice in their weekly activities to complement their walking or cardio exercise. 

- **Listening to Your Body:** A recurring theme from de Grey is paying attention to your body’s signals. In exercise, this is particularly apt. He would advise against pushing through severe pain or exhaustion for the sake of hitting an arbitrary fitness goal. **Rest and recovery are as important as exercise itself**. If you’re injured or overly fatigued, it’s better to back off and heal than to risk chronic injury, which could set you back much further. The idea is to cultivate a sustainable exercise habit that you can maintain for life. Many people start intense workout programs only to burn out or quit – de Grey’s more relaxed approach might actually be more sustainable, encouraging people to find physical activities they enjoy and can keep doing for decades. Consistent moderate exercise throughout life likely yields greater longevity benefits than short bursts of extreme training that can’t be maintained.

### The Role of Exercise in Aging  
De Grey acknowledges that **exercise is one of the few interventions today that clearly correlates with better healthspan and somewhat longer lifespan**. Fit individuals have lower incidence of many chronic diseases. However, he also reminds us that even the best exercise and diet routines **cannot overcome the eventual accumulation of damage that aging causes**. In his perspective, a person who does everything “right” – eats healthy, exercises daily, doesn’t smoke – might gain a handful of extra years of life compared to a person who neglects those things. Those extra years are incredibly valuable and worthwhile, but they **aren’t the multiple decades or more that true anti-aging therapies could one day provide**. Thus, he treats exercise as a **bridge to the future**: it’s a way of staying as healthy as possible in the present, staving off diseases in your 50s, 60s, and 70s so that you can be alive and in good shape when rejuvenation breakthroughs (like stem cell therapies, gene therapies, etc.) become available. 

- **Aging vs. Fitness:** An interesting point de Grey has made is that **“the best way to live a long time these days is to pay attention to your body and do what works”** [Big Think Interview](https://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-aubrey-de-grey/). This implies that if your body is aging faster in one aspect, you might target that with exercise. For example, if you notice you’re losing stamina, you might emphasize aerobic workouts; if you’re losing strength, you might incorporate more resistance training. Exercise can combat specific aspects of aging: weight training counters muscle loss, impact exercise (like walking or mild jogging) helps maintain bone density, and cardio helps preserve lung and heart function. **It won’t stop aging altogether, but it compresses morbidity – it helps ensure that the decline comes later and more suddenly rather than as a long, drawn-out frailty.** De Grey’s goal for individuals is to remain in as good health as possible, for as long as possible, so that when advanced therapies come, they have not already succumbed to age-related disability or death. In that context, regular exercise is a powerful tool.

In summary, **Aubrey de Grey’s exercise philosophy is about balance and personalization**. He doesn’t push extreme workouts, but he absolutely recognizes that staying physically active is vital for healthy aging. His personal example – doing moderate exercise, staying lean, and not overexerting – shows that one can maintain excellent health by being consistent and sensible with physical activity. The bottom line: **avoid a sedentary lifestyle, engage in regular moderate exercise that you enjoy, and keep your body strong and mobile** as you age. This will maximize your chances of living long enough and well enough to benefit from future longevity innovations.

## Diagnostics and Biomarker Tracking  
### Pay Attention to Your Body’s Signals  
A core part of de Grey’s advice for longevity is to **remain in tune with your body’s condition**. Rather than following any fad or generalized regimen blindly, he suggests using your own health indicators as a guide. In practice, this means **monitoring key health metrics and biomarkers** over time to catch any negative trends early. De Grey himself mentions that he keeps track of measures like body weight, body composition, and blood test results, which he reports are “extremely good in every way” for him [Big Think Interview](https://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-aubrey-de-grey/). By keeping an eye on such markers, one can know whether current lifestyle practices are effective or if adjustments might be needed.

- **Regular Check-ups and Blood Work:** De Grey would likely endorse the idea of getting regular medical check-ups and blood panels appropriate for one’s age and risk factors. These can include tests for cholesterol levels, blood sugar (glucose and HbA1c), liver and kidney function, inflammatory markers, etc. If you’re following a normal lifestyle and your numbers are all in healthy ranges, that reaffirms that “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” On the other hand, if a routine test shows something borderline – say rising fasting glucose or high LDL cholesterol – that’s a signal to intervene early (perhaps improving diet or exercise, or taking medication if needed) to prevent progression to disease. **Preventive healthcare** is a key part of longevity: finding issues while they’re still small and reversible. De Grey’s own strategy of doing minimal but targeted interventions is built on knowing that all his health indicators are fine. For someone else, knowing their biological status is the first step to making personalized decisions (for example, a person with high inflammation might benefit from specific supplements or diets to lower it, whereas another person might not need those at all).

- **Biological Age Testing:** In recent years, various tests have emerged that attempt to measure “biological age” – how old your body seems functionally or molecularly, as opposed to your calendar age. These include **epigenetic clocks** (which look at DNA methylation patterns), telomere length tests, and composite biomarker indices. Aubrey de Grey has commented on biomarkers of aging, stressing the importance of finding reliable measures that correlate with the underlying damage of aging. He has been involved with or supportive of projects like the **AgeMeter**, which uses functional tests (cognitive and physical tasks) to gauge biological age in a practical way. De Grey values such tools because they can help assess whether an intervention is actually making someone physiologically younger. For an individual interested in longevity, tracking your biological age via a reputable epigenetic test or functional test can be motivating and informative. However, de Grey also cautions that some epigenetic changes are more “noise” than cause – meaning not all changes measured by these clocks are necessarily things that need fixing. They are proxies. He supports research to improve these markers but would advise people not to obsess over a single biological age readout. Instead, use them alongside traditional markers to get a fuller picture of health.

### Tracking Personal Health Data  
De Grey’s philosophy encourages a form of **self-scientific mindset**: treat your body as something to gather data on and learn from. This doesn’t require professional lab work alone – even simple at-home tracking can help. For example, monitoring your blood pressure at home, using a fitness tracker to log activity and heart rate, or using a glucometer if you’re at risk for diabetes can yield valuable insights. If you adopt a new diet or supplement, you might track changes in how you feel or any relevant blood markers after a few months to see if it’s helping or not.

- **Baseline Measurements:** One practical tip is to get a thorough baseline measurement of your health while you’re presumably healthy (ideally in young adulthood). This could involve a full blood panel, a measure of VO2 max (aerobic fitness), body composition analysis, and maybe even some advanced tests like coronary artery calcium score or carotid ultrasound to check for any early atherosclerosis (if middle-aged). De Grey hasn’t detailed these specifically, but as a longevity advocate, he recognizes that some seemingly healthy people might have hidden risks (e.g., high calcium in arteries indicating heart disease risk, or low bone density indicating osteoporosis risk). Knowing these things decades in advance means you can take action (like more exercise or medications) to mitigate the risk. So, working with healthcare providers to get periodic comprehensive health assessments can be very useful.

- **Biomarker Trends vs. Snapshots:** It’s not just about one-time results; it’s about trends. De Grey would agree that seeing how your biomarkers change over time is crucial. For example, if your cholesterol was low in your 40s but has been rising each year, that trend is important even if it’s not yet “high.” Similarly, a slow upward creep in blood sugar might be a sign to cut back on carbs or lose a bit of weight before it becomes diabetes. By catching unfavorable trends in biomarkers, one can implement lifestyle changes or therapies early. This embodies de Grey’s preventive mindset – **maintain robustness for as long as possible**. The longer you can prevent the onset of age-related ailments through vigilant health monitoring and action, the greater the chance you’ll reach the era of advanced anti-aging therapies in good shape.

- **Genetic Testing:** An area de Grey hasn’t spoken about much in the context of personal longevity strategy is genetic testing. However, in general, understanding your genetic predispositions (through services that check for health-related gene variants) can be another piece of useful data. If one discovers, for instance, a genetic tendency for higher Alzheimer’s risk (such as an APOE-ε4 allele) or a predisposition to cancer, they might take extra precautions in lifestyle (like more rigorous cardiovascular exercise and a diet supportive of brain health, or more frequent cancer screenings). The SENS approach targets damage repair that should help everyone regardless of genetics, but while those therapies are in development, **knowing your personal risk factors can guide current prevention**. De Grey’s stance would likely be: the more you know about your body, the better you can manage it, as long as you use reliable science to interpret that information.

### Medical Screening and Early Interventions  
Regular interaction with the medical system for screening is an important part of longevity. De Grey often emphasizes not dying of things that are already preventable today. For example, he notes he **takes care to avoid early death from accidents** (like diligently wearing seat belts) [Big Think Interview](https://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-aubrey-de-grey/) – similarly, one should avoid early death from detectable diseases by utilizing medical screening. 

- **Cancer Screening:** Following guidelines for cancer screenings (such as colonoscopies, mammograms for women, prostate checks for men, etc.) can catch cancers at an earlier, more treatable stage. De Grey has a keen interest in defeating cancer in the long run (through therapies like WILT or telomerase manipulation), but until those are realized, he’d certainly advise using the best of today’s medicine to not die of cancer. That means a colonoscopy at 50 (or even earlier if family history is strong), regular dermatology checks for suspicious moles, and so forth. None of these stop aging, but they can stop an individual from dying before the fruits of anti-aging research arrive.

- **Cardiovascular Check-ups:** Heart disease remains the number one killer in most countries. There are now advanced diagnostics like coronary artery calcium scoring or CT angiograms that can give a picture of one’s heart disease status before a heart attack occurs. For someone with risk factors, these tests can inform aggressive preventive measures (like statins, diet changes, etc.). De Grey’s philosophy is not against medical interventions – he’s against *unnecessary* or *ineffective* ones. If a test clearly shows a big risk (like serious arterial plaque), then taking a medication to lower that risk is just sensible risk reduction, the same way wearing a seat belt is. In fact, he has explicitly said he looks after problems associated with risk of early death by sensible precautions [Big Think Interview](https://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-aubrey-de-grey/). In a sense, taking a proven medication to reduce heart attack risk at age 60 is analogous to that approach – it’s preventing an early death so you can live to see 80 or 90 and possibly benefit from rejuvenation therapies by then.

- **Cognitive and Functional Testing:** As part of healthy aging, one should also monitor cognitive function and other functional abilities (vision, hearing, balance). While de Grey focuses on biological repair, he would acknowledge the human aspect of aging: losing memory or independence is something to avoid. Engaging in routine cognitive screening (there are simple memory or executive function tests doctors can perform) might catch early cognitive decline. If something like mild cognitive impairment is detected, interventions like improved cardiovascular health (which helps the brain), cognitive exercises, or experimental therapies can be considered. Similarly, checking hearing and vision and getting aids (hearing aids, glasses or cataract surgery) when needed will keep a person engaged and active, which feeds back into better health and less stress. De Grey’s holistic view is that **healthspan is as important as lifespan** – so maintaining all facets of health through appropriate diagnostics is well in line with his recommendations.

In sum, **Diagnostics and Biomarker Tracking** in de Grey’s longevity strategy boil down to: **know thyself (medically)**. Use modern medicine’s tools to understand what’s happening in your body as you age, then respond accordingly. This proactive management means you are not flying blind; you can make evidence-based decisions on lifestyle or treatments. De Grey’s own example of monitoring his blood markers and being aware of his biological youthfulness illustrates that being informed about your health is empowering. It enables you to stay on the optimal path – making course corrections as needed – toward a longer, healthier life.

## Regenerative and Emerging Therapies  
### The SENS Paradigm: Repairing Cellular Damage  
Aubrey de Grey’s central contribution to longevity science is the **SENS (Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence)** framework, which identifies seven types of cellular and molecular damage that accumulate with age and outlines regenerative therapies to fix each of them. In the context of personal longevity strategies, de Grey encourages people to stay aware of and supportive of these emerging therapies, as they hold the keys to **dramatically extending healthy lifespan** beyond what lifestyle alone can do. While these therapies are still in development (as of 2025), some have reached early human trials or even limited clinical use. De Grey’s present-day belief is that **combination rejuvenation therapy is the future** – meaning we will use multiple regenerative treatments together to periodically restore the body’s youthful structure and function. Here we discuss several of the most important categories of emerging therapies that de Grey highlights:

- **Senolytics (Removing Senescent Cells):** As mentioned earlier, senescent cells are “dead weight” cells that secrete harmful factors and contribute to aging and chronic inflammation. De Grey considers senolytic therapy one of the first real proofs of concept for SENS in living animals. By using drugs or gene therapies to clear these cells, researchers have made old mice look and act like younger mice in certain respects. De Grey notes that even lifespan itself was extended in mice treated late in life with a senolytic – a surprising and encouraging result. Currently, companies like Unity Biotechnology and others have been testing senolytics for diseases like osteoarthritis, lung fibrosis, and diabetic kidney disease (on the premise that these diseases are exacerbated by senescent cells). De Grey’s view is that as these are validated, they will likely be used more broadly for general age-related decline. For an individual looking to live a long time, this means in the near future one might undergo **periodic senolytic treatments** – perhaps an infusion or a course of pills every few years – to keep the burden of senescent cells low. De Grey actively follows this field and even suggested that if philanthropists can fund trials for senolytics as boldly as they did for metformin’s TAME trial, it would be money better spent. In practical terms: We can expect senolytic supplements or drugs to become part of longevity medicine, and de Grey would endorse their use once proven safe, as a way to **regenerate tissues by subtraction (removing bad cells)**.

- **Stem Cell Therapies (Replacing Lost Cells):** Another pillar of SENS is **RepleniSENS**, which is about restoring cell populations that have dwindled with age. As we get older, certain cells don’t regenerate well (for example, heart muscle cells, neurons in some brain regions, or the cells that produce dopamine in the brain). Stem cell therapy aims to introduce new youthful cells to replace those lost or dysfunctional cells. De Grey points out that many stem cell therapies are already in clinical trials for age-related conditions, such as using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived dopaminergic neurons to treat Parkinson’s disease ([Aubrey de Grey on Progress in SENS Rejuvenation Research – Fight Aging!](https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2022/07/aubrey-de-grey-on-progress-in-sens-rejuvenation-research/#:~:text=,THIO%20for%20short%2C%20which%20is)). In Japan, a pioneering trial has been injecting such cells into Parkinson’s patients’ brains, attempting to restore their neuron population. De Grey is encouraged by these and notes similar trials are planned in the US ([Aubrey de Grey on Progress in SENS Rejuvenation Research – Fight Aging!](https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2022/07/aubrey-de-grey-on-progress-in-sens-rejuvenation-research/#:~:text=,THIO%20for%20short%2C%20which%20is)). For personal planning, this suggests that in coming years, treatments like **stem cell infusions for heart health, joints, or even brain health** might become available. For instance, one could imagine a future 80-year-old receiving periodic stem cell infusions to rejuvenate their immune system or repair organs. De Grey’s advice is to stay informed about these therapies and be ready to take advantage of them when they are accessible. They directly address one of aging’s fundamental problems: cells that should be there are no longer there or functional, so we put fresh ones in.

- **Gene Therapy and Genomic Repair:** Gene therapy is a broad category, but in aging, some specific gene therapy strategies excite de Grey. One is **telomere management** – in SENS, the idea of WILT (Whole-body Induced Lack of Telomerase) was proposed to eliminate cancer risk by disabling the telomerase gene in all cells and using stem cells to replenish tissues instead. That was a very forward-looking concept. Now, a modern analogue is THIO, 6-thio-deoxyguanine, which de Grey calls “WILT 2.0”. THIO is a small molecule, not a gene therapy, but it acts like a gene therapy by targeting telomerase: it causes any cell with active telomerase (typically cancer cells) to die off by turning telomerase’s action against the cell. This drug is currently in Phase 2 trials for cancer, and de Grey is quite enthusiastic about it, because it could potentially be used as a **preventative measure against cancer** in otherwise healthy people in the future. Imagine, say at age 50, taking a course of a telomerase-sabotaging treatment that kills off the most dangerous pre-cancerous cells in your body – this could drastically reduce cancer incidence in old age. That’s an example of how therapies overlap between treating diseases and extending healthy life. De Grey also references other gene therapy ideas, such as removing harmful genes or adding new ones that help clean up waste inside cells. With the advent of CRISPR and improved gene delivery, he notes that genetic editing is far easier now than a decade ago. One still needs good delivery systems to get gene therapies into all tissues, but progress is being made. In the not too distant future, **rejuvenation gene therapies** might include things like turning on regenerative genes that are normally off in adults, or editing out senescence-associated genes. De Grey’s position is to **embrace gene therapy when it’s ready**, since it can tackle problems at a fundamental level (for example, giving cells new instructions to behave like younger cells or to resist aging processes).

- **Clearing Molecular Waste (LysoSENS and AmyloSENS):** Two more categories of damage de Grey emphasizes are intracellular junk (things like lipofuscin or misfolded proteins inside cells) and extracellular junk (like amyloid plaques between cells). Therapies are being developed to address these too. For instance, **LysoSENS** involves finding enzymes (often from bacteria) that can break down wastes that human cells cannot otherwise degrade. De Grey’s team has worked on enzymes to break down a crosslink called glucosepane (which stiffens arteries and tissue) and on enzymes to digest intracellular wastes that contribute to macular degeneration. If these enzymes are turned into therapies (like injectable enzymes or gene therapies that deliver the enzyme to cells), they could literally **dissolve age-related waste products**, cleaning the cells. Similarly, **immunotherapy is being used to clear extracellular aggregates**: for example, antibodies against beta-amyloid in Alzheimer’s (some of which are now FDA-approved for early Alzheimer’s) align with the AmyloSENS strategy of removing amyloid plaques. De Grey notes that removing amyloid and restoring some function in Alzheimer’s is on the list of near-term achievements. So, an eye toward personal benefit: someone in middle age might bank on the likelihood that by their late age, there will be treatments to periodically clear such wastes – whether it’s a drug that breaks crosslinks to keep skin and blood vessels supple, or a vaccine that clears amyloid to protect the brain. De Grey would advise being willing to adopt these once proven, because they tackle aging on a deep level (accumulated junk is a root cause of tissue dysfunction).

### Longevity Escape Velocity and the Multi-Modal Future  
De Grey often speaks of **“longevity escape velocity” (LEV)** – the point at which medicine can extend a person’s healthy life faster than time is passing, essentially staying ahead of aging. His estimate is that there is a 50% chance we might reach LEV in about 12-15 years from now (as of the mid-2020s). What this means for current adults is that the first generation of rejuvenation therapies might add, say, 10-20 healthy years, during which time improved versions come along that add another 20, and so on, eventually making aging a manageable condition. De Grey’s personal plan is essentially to **live long enough to live forever (or at least indefinitely)** by benefiting from these successive waves of therapy. Therefore, he encourages longevity enthusiasts to **take part in or support clinical trials and emerging therapies**. Not only does this speed up the research (if you volunteer for a trial or donate to research, you push the field forward), but you also might get early access to life-extending treatments.

- **Current Trials and Participation:** If you are an older individual or have an age-related condition, you might consider enrolling in trials for some of these therapies. For example, trials of senolytic drugs for osteoarthritis or metformin for aging (TAME) or rapamycin for immune function in the elderly are all ongoing. De Grey’s view is that we need these trials to succeed and to demonstrate results. He has even expressed that if resources allow, more ambitious combination trials should be done. In 2021-2022, after parting ways with SENS Research Foundation, de Grey co-founded the **Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation (LEV Foundation)**, which is conducting a study known as **Robust Mouse Rejuvenation** (RMR) trial. The RMR trial is testing a combination of several therapies in mice all at once – basically the SENS cocktail – to see if it can dramatically extend mouse lifespan. De Grey has reported updates (for instance, via social media) indicating some mice are living longer than expected on combination treatments. This combinatorial approach will likely be translated to human trials in the future. So, someone aiming to maximize their own lifespan should keep an eye on these advancements: **the moment we have even early human data on multi-therapy rejuvenation, it would be wise (with medical guidance) to try to access them**.

- **Early Access and Medical Tourism:** It’s worth noting that some cutting-edge therapies might become available in certain countries or via private clinics before they are mainstream. For example, stem cell clinics (some reputable, some dubious) already offer treatments. Similarly, once senolytics are proven in trials, doctors might prescribe them off-label. Aubrey de Grey doesn’t explicitly advocate unregulated treatments – he’s a scientist first and wants evidence – but he understands the drive patients have to get therapies as soon as possible. The balance he’d recommend is caution with unproven interventions (to not waste money or get harmed) versus the benefit of not waiting too long once something does appear effective. Essentially, **be prepared to take advantage of new therapies when they cross a threshold of safety and efficacy, even if they are not yet fully approved for aging itself**. This might mean, for instance, if you’re 70 and a senolytic drug gets approved for, say, pulmonary fibrosis, you might talk to your doctor about using it off-label to clear senescent cells generally. Over time, more and more therapies will cross that line.

- **Mindset of Rejuvenation:** De Grey encourages thinking of aging as a medical problem with a technical solution. This shift in mindset is important. Instead of seeing aging as something mystical or fundamentally unalterable, see your body as a machine that can be maintained. He famously compares the body to a car – if you can replace or repair parts, you can keep it running indefinitely, as long as you do it proactively ([Silicon Valley's Quest to Live Forever | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/silicon-valleys-quest-to-live-forever#:~:text=Silicon%20Valley%27s%20Quest%20to%20Live,physics%20of%20combustion%2C%20and)). Adopting this mindset personally means you would not shy away from medical interventions as you age; rather, you’d seek them out much like one takes their car in for scheduled maintenance. Regenerative therapies are those maintenance procedures. So in the future, a proactive individual might have a schedule: maybe every 10 years they undergo a comprehensive rejuvenation “service” – clearing senescent cells, replenishing stem cells, fixing gene errors, removing protein aggregates, etc. While this scenario is still emerging, de Grey’s current belief is that **most of the pieces for that scenario are being assembled right now in laboratories and clinical trials around the world**. 

In conclusion, **Regenerative and Emerging Therapies** are the crux of Aubrey de Grey’s strategy for those who truly want to maximize their lifespan. His advice is to **stay healthy for now using the means in earlier sections, but also stay informed and ready for the breakthroughs**. These therapies – senolytics, stem cells, gene therapies, novel drugs – will move from the lab to the clinic in the coming years. Being an early adopter (prudently) could mean the difference between merely living an average lifespan and greatly surpassing it. De Grey is optimistic that many people alive today (perhaps even people currently middle-aged) will have the opportunity to benefit from these interventions and **potentially live well beyond the current human limits**, in good health, thanks to regenerative medicine.

## Lifestyle Principles and Psychological Factors  
### Risk Mitigation: Don’t Die Stupidly  
Aubrey de Grey often emphasizes that one of the best things you can do for longevity is **simply not to die for avoidable reasons**. While that sounds obvious, it encapsulates a proactive approach to reducing risks in daily life. For example, de Grey says he **always wears a seat belt, even when riding in the back seat of a car** [Big Think Interview](https://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-aubrey-de-grey/). This trivial habit can significantly reduce the chance of dying in an auto accident. Similarly, he mentions **not accepting speaking invitations in dangerous countries** or areas where personal safety might be at heightened risk [Big Think Interview](https://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-aubrey-de-grey/). The principle is: protect yourself from premature death causes that are not related to aging at all. These include accidents, violence, infections, and other environmental threats.

- **Avoiding Harmful Habits:** Under risk mitigation, we also consider lifestyle choices known to cause early mortality. De Grey doesn’t explicitly preach about smoking or heavy alcohol use, likely because the dangers are well-known, but as a longevity expert he would surely list **“don’t smoke”** among obvious advice. Smoking increases the risk of almost every age-related disease (cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung diseases) and can easily subtract a decade or more from one’s life. Quitting smoking (or never starting) is thus a huge longevity win. Excessive alcohol consumption likewise can lead to liver disease, accidents, and other issues; moderation or abstention keeps those risks low. **Drug abuse** and other high-risk behaviors (like reckless driving, extreme sports without proper precautions, etc.) are similarly counterproductive for someone aiming to live a very long life. De Grey himself is not a puritan – he’s often seen with his signature beer, and moderate alcohol (like a glass of wine or beer a day) might even have some health benefits or at least doesn’t seem to shorten life for most – but he clearly avoids abusing substances. The key lifestyle principle: **cut out the known major risk factors for disease and trauma**. This alone gets you far along the path of a healthy lifespan.

- **Medical Vigilance:** Another aspect of avoiding stupid deaths is to treat serious conditions promptly. For instance, if you have symptoms of a possible heart attack or stroke, seeking immediate medical help can be life-saving. Many people die or suffer severe impairments simply by ignoring danger signs. De Grey would advise not to be in denial about medical issues – today’s medicine can often address acute problems effectively if they’re caught in time. Also, adhering to prescribed treatments (like taking blood pressure medication if you have hypertension) falls under this pragmatic approach: it might not be “natural” or glamorous, but it prevents early death from heart failure or stroke, giving you the chance to reach future breakthroughs. As he says, the best way to live long is to “do what works” for your health and not leave issues unaddressed [Big Think Interview](https://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-aubrey-de-grey/).

### Stress Management: The Centenarian Mindset  
One of the most fascinating insights de Grey shares is about the **role of psychological stress in aging**. Chronic stress can accelerate aging processes via hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which in excess can damage the body. De Grey notes that it’s “reasonably well understood” that being in a stressed-out state chronically leads to faster accumulation of aging damage [Joe Rogan Podcast](https://ogjre.com/clip/aubrey-de-grey-centenarians-have-one-thing-in-common). Therefore, managing stress is not just about feeling better mentally – it’s a genuine longevity strategy.

- **Nothing Bothers Them:** In discussing studies of centenarians, de Grey points out a commonality: *“there’s one thing that almost all centenarians have in common, which is that nothing bothers them.”* [Joe Rogan Podcast](https://ogjre.com/clip/aubrey-de-grey-centenarians-have-one-thing-in-common). This doesn’t mean these people never experienced stress; rather, when faced with difficulties, they cope extremely well. They do not dwell on stressors or allow their bodies to remain in a high-stress state for long. For example, if a centenarian gets into an argument or deals with a loss, they tend to “not lose sleep” over it and recover their equanimity quickly. Physiologically, their cortisol spikes are smaller or shorter, meaning their tissues aren’t exposed to those aging-accelerating hormones as much as in a highly anxious person. The lesson here is to **cultivate a mindset of resilience and calm**. Whether through techniques like meditation, mindfulness, yoga, or simply by personality adaptation (“don’t fret the small stuff”), keeping psychological stress in check likely helps you age more slowly. De Grey himself, when asked if he meditates, said, *“No, I’m just chill anyway.”*. He has a naturally relaxed temperament and doesn’t let his very busy life overwhelm him mentally. Those of us not so naturally laid-back might need to actively develop stress-reduction practices as part of our longevity lifestyle.

- **Community and Purpose:** The question that led de Grey to discuss stress was about other factors like community, enjoyment, and life satisfaction [Joe Rogan Podcast](https://ogjre.com/clip/aubrey-de-grey-centenarians-have-one-thing-in-common). He acknowledges that those are “definitely big” factors too. A strong social network, loving relationships, and having a sense of purpose are well-known correlates of longer life. These factors likely work partly by reducing chronic stress and improving mental health. When you enjoy life and feel supported, you experience less detrimental stress. De Grey’s work is very purpose-driven (he’s trying to save a billion lives by curing aging), and that passion likely fuels his own well-being. For others, finding meaningful work or hobbies, staying connected with friends and family, and perhaps engaging in community or spiritual groups can foster the psychological resilience that centenarians seem to share. In short, **stay socially and emotionally fulfilled** – it’s not just pleasant, it’s potentially life-extending.

- **Avoiding the Health Obsession Stress:** Interestingly, a nuance to stress management is not becoming overly stressed *about* health itself. Some longevity enthusiasts may go to extreme lengths, constantly worrying about every calorie, every test result, every new supplement. This in itself can create stress. De Grey’s balanced approach – where he doesn’t micromanage his diet or regimen – can be instructive. He focuses on big-picture strategies and otherwise “doesn’t worry” day-to-day. He noted that many very old people are not worrying constantly; they have a kind of acceptance or at least a lack of neurotic stress about things. So while it’s good to be informed and take action for health, it’s counterproductive to live in fear of aging or death to the point of anxiety. The goal is to be prudent yet relaxed. Do what you can, and then live your life.

### Positive Outlook and The Pro-Aging Trance  
De Grey often talks about overcoming the **“pro-aging trance”**, which is society’s complacent or fatalistic attitude toward aging. In an individual sense, escaping this trance means **believing that living much longer is possible and worth striving for**. This positive outlook can have concrete effects: if you believe you have a chance at a vigorous 100+ year life, you’re more likely to take care of your health and make plans for the future. If you assume you’ll be decrepit by 70, you might unconsciously fulfill that prophecy by not investing in your health or by mentally “giving up” at a certain age.

- **Hope and Motivation:** De Grey provides a hopeful perspective that aging can be defeated or dramatically delayed. Embracing this hope can be motivating to stick to healthy habits. It also combats ageism and the idea that getting old means an inevitable decline. People who maintain a sense of purpose and goals into their later years (like planning projects, learning new things, staying curious) tend to live longer and happier lives. De Grey at age 60+ is still energetically pursuing scientific goals, clearly not thinking of himself as “old” in the traditional sense. Adopting a similar forward-looking mentality – that your contributions and adventures can continue for decades to come – helps maintain psychological youth.

- **Avoiding Despair:** Conversely, avoiding a negative, despondent view of aging is important. Some people in midlife have a crisis and think everything is downhill from here. That stress and despair can shorten life. De Grey’s optimism, which some have called unrealistic, actually serves as a powerful antidote to such despair. He firmly believes that *“not dying of aging is, of course, the point”* and that many of us have a real chance at it. This doesn’t guarantee it will happen, but the belief encourages action (like supporting research or personal health optimization) and reduces the psychological burden of aging. Essentially, a **mindset of proactive optimism** is part of his recommended lifestyle. It costs nothing, but it can influence both your behaviors and perhaps even psychosomatic aspects of health.

### Life Enjoyment and Balance  
Living a long time is only valuable if those years are worth living. De Grey and other longevity researchers often emphasize **quality of life (healthspan) along with lifespan**. This means a lifestyle that includes joy, hobbies, relaxation, and fulfillment is not at odds with longevity – it is an integral part of it. 

- **Recreation and Relaxation:** In interviews, de Grey has mentioned the importance of recreation. For instance, regarding his annual longevity conference, he says they “emphasize the recreational aspect very heavily” alongside the science, showing his belief that fun and socializing are key parts of life. Taking time to relax, travel, socialize, or have a beer with friends (as de Grey does) helps maintain mental health and reduce burnout. If one were to be extremely ascetic or workaholic in pursuit of longevity, they might actually do more harm than good. A balanced life with downtime and laughter is healthier. Many centenarian studies, such as those of Blue Zones (regions with exceptional longevity), find that people often have strong social bonds, daily laughter, and routines that include leisure (like afternoon naps or evening chats with neighbors). De Grey’s own lifestyle, though busy, does not exclude recreation – he’s known to enjoy music, good food, and camaraderie. So, **incorporate enjoyment as a longevity strategy**: it keeps you psychologically young and provides the emotional resilience to handle life’s challenges.

- **Lifelong Learning and Mental Stimulation:** De Grey once quipped, “I don’t know anybody well-educated who gets bored”, suggesting that staying mentally engaged prevents the stagnation that can sometimes accompany aging. He himself, coming from a computer science background into biology, exemplifies lifelong learning and intellectual flexibility. Keeping the brain active – whether through one’s career, reading, puzzles, or social debate – may help ward off cognitive decline. It also gives a sense of progress and hope. If you’re always learning or working on something interesting, you always have a reason to look forward to tomorrow. This engagement is a soft factor in longevity but a meaningful one.

- **Attitude Towards Aging:** Adopting what psychologists call a “positive aging self-perception” can actually influence health. People who view aging as a positive stage (with wisdom, freedom, etc.) tend to live longer than those who view it negatively. De Grey’s public stance that being 70 or 80 in the future might not mean being frail at all can help people envision their future self in a positive light. That likely encourages better self-care and reduces stress about aging. Rather than fearing age, de Grey suggests we fight the causes of age but not necessarily dread the number. He, for example, is in his early 60s but as biologically youthful as someone much younger, and he fully expects to benefit from upcoming advances that will make his later decades even healthier. This attitude can be contagious – in a good way.

### Contribution and Engagement  
Finally, de Grey often calls on those who care about longevity to **get involved in the mission**, whether scientifically, entrepreneurially, or philanthropically. This is slightly tangential to personal health, but it loops back into psychological factors: having a cause to work toward (like supporting aging research or advocating for longevity) can provide purpose and community. It also indirectly accelerates the arrival of the very therapies one hopes to use.

- **Volunteering and Advocacy:** If one has the means, contributing to longevity research funding (through donations or investing in biotech) is something de Grey explicitly encourages, as it can help “buy time” for everyone by bringing therapies sooner. If one doesn’t have means, even spreading the word or learning and sharing knowledge helps. This kind of advocacy can give personal satisfaction (knowing you’re part of the solution) and connects you with a network of like-minded people, which circles back to the benefit of community.

- **Intergenerational Perspective:** De Grey sometimes mentions that **we have a duty to future older selves and to current older generations to solve aging**. For an individual, respecting and caring for the elderly now (helping them stay healthy, for instance) is a way of practicing what we preach. It can also give insights into healthy aging – many centenarians have shared their life lessons, and often they emphasize simple joys, relationships, and moderation, which aligns well with de Grey’s personal practices. By engaging with older people and society’s approach to aging, one can reinforce one’s own commitment to a healthy lifestyle.

In summary, **Lifestyle and Psychological Factors** in de Grey’s longevity advice revolve around being sensible, steady, and positive. Avoid dying young by accidents or bad habits. Keep stress low and spirits high. Enjoy life and find meaning, as those will carry you through the years with vigor. Aging need not be accompanied by the usual mental decline or negativity; one can remain youthful in mindset. De Grey himself is a living example of a youthful outlook combined with pragmatic habits. He’s “chill,” focused, and refuses to accept that aging will inevitably make him feeble – and he suggests that all of us adopt a similar stance while doing what we realistically can to stay healthy. By coupling this robust mindset with the earlier sections’ physical health strategies, one creates a comprehensive lifestyle geared toward longevity.

## Conclusion  
Aubrey de Grey’s current recommendations for living a long, healthy life form a holistic approach combining **common-sense lifestyle choices with forward-looking anticipation of medical advances**. In summary, de Grey advises maintaining one’s health with **balanced diet, moderate exercise, and basic preventive care**, rather than chasing extreme fads or unproven supplements. He stresses the importance of **monitoring your own health metrics** and addressing issues early – effectively, being the steward of your body’s maintenance until more powerful tools arrive. Crucially, he underscores managing stress and staying positive: mental well-being and resilience emerge as silent but significant longevity enhancers in his view, as exemplified by the world’s longest-lived individuals.

At the same time, de Grey is clear that **incremental lifestyle improvements can only go so far**. To truly break the limits of human lifespan, we must leverage emerging therapies. He encourages staying informed and, when safe and appropriate, incorporating new medical breakthroughs – such as senolytic drugs to periodically rejuvenate tissues, or stem cell therapies to repair organs – into one’s personal health strategy. His concept of *“longevity escape velocity”* is not a guarantee but a motivating target: by doing everything possible to **avoid dying from today’s causes**, you increase your odds of reaching tomorrow’s anti-aging innovations, which in turn keep you alive even longer in a virtuous cycle.

In practical terms, someone following Aubrey de Grey’s guidance today would:  
- **Eat normally and nutritiously**, listening to their body and avoiding overeating or nutrient deficiencies, but not getting caught up in restrictive diets.  
- Possibly practice **intermittent fasting in moderation** for health benefits, but not expecting it to dramatically extend lifespan.  
- **Forego unproven supplements** unless there’s a specific reason, focusing instead on proven measures (like necessary medications, or targeted use of supplements under medical advice).  
- Engage in **regular physical activity** suited to their abilities – enough to stay fit, strong, and metabolically healthy, but not necessarily extreme endurance or body-building unless personally inclined.  
- Keep track of health indicators (weight, blood pressure, blood tests, etc.) and go for **preventive screenings**, treating any risk factors (like high blood pressure or early disease signs) to avert serious outcomes.  
- Embrace **new medical options** as they become available: for instance, consider taking senolytic therapies or others in a clinical trial or once evidence supports them, to proactively reduce aging damage.  
- **Avoid needless risks** – from smoking to unsafe driving – thereby preserving one’s life and health for the long term.  
- Cultivate a **stress-resilient, optimistic mindset**. This might include relaxation practices or simply fostering a positive outlook where one believes in and works toward a longer healthy future.  
- Maintain **social connections, purpose, and joy**, recognizing these intangible factors truly matter for both quality and length of life.

All the above practices are **explicitly aligned with de Grey’s stated views** in recent years. Importantly, none of these involve magic or pseudoscience – they are grounded in either well-supported health science or in ongoing credible research. De Grey’s unique contribution is in tying them together with an eye on the future. He neither promises immortality now nor is complacent with the status quo; instead, he charts a course where one takes care of the basics and simultaneously pushes the frontiers forward.

By following Aubrey de Grey’s current guidance, individuals can maximize their chances of enjoying robust health deep into old age – and perhaps, if de Grey’s optimistic timeline proves correct, be part of the generation that leaps into unprecedented longevity. As he often reminds us, the goal is not just to live long, but to **stay truly youthful for as long as possible**, until aging itself can be fully tamed. Every seat belt fastened, every healthy meal, every jog in the park, and every new therapy adopted are, in his philosophy, steps toward that vision of ageless living.
