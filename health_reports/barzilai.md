# Dr. Nir Barzilai: Pioneering Longevity Research and Healthy Aging

## Background and Career  
Dr. **Nir Barzilai** is an Israeli-American physician-scientist internationally recognized for his work on the biology of aging and exceptional longevity. Born in Haifa, Israel in 1955, Barzilai served as an army medic (even participating in the 1976 Entebbe rescue operation) and credits his military service with instilling a can-do attitude: *“The most helpful years in my life were in the Israeli army… you realize that you can do a lot! If it doesn't frighten you, you can do a lot.”* ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=Amiably%20aggressive%2C%20Barzilai%20credits%20his,It%27s%20a%20whole%20lifetime)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=okay%3F%20With%20a%20lot%20of,you%20can%20do%20a%20lot)). After obtaining his M.D. from Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in 1985, he moved to the United States for training in endocrinology and metabolism ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=After%20obtaining%20his%20M,I%27m%20in%20the%20United%20States)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=plans,I%27m%20in%20the%20United%20States)). In 1993, he joined the faculty of Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, where he noticed a remarkable local cohort of centenarians (people aged ~100+) and their families ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=In%201993%2C%20he%20landed%20a,both%20centenarians%20and%20their%20children)). This led him to found the **Institute for Aging Research** at Einstein, where he is a Professor of Medicine and Genetics. He also directs Einstein’s **Nathan Shock Center** and the **Paul F. Glenn Center** for the Biology of Human Aging Research ([Nir Barzilai - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nir_Barzilai#:~:text=Barzilai%20is%20the%20founding%20director,a%20biotechnology)) ([Nir Barzilai - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nir_Barzilai#:~:text=Fields%20genetics%20and%20biology%20of,Albert%20Einstein%20College%20of%20Medicine)). 

Barzilai launched the **Longevity Genes Project**, a study of hundreds of centenarians (all Ashkenazi Jews for genetic consistency) and their offspring, to unravel genetic and biological factors that contribute to extreme longevity ([Nir Barzilai - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nir_Barzilai#:~:text=Barzilai%20is%20the%20founding%20director,a%20biotechnology)) ([Nir Barzilai - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nir_Barzilai#:~:text=Project%2C,treat%20diseases%20associated%20with%20aging)). Today, he is a leading figure in geroscience, serving as Scientific Director of the American Federation for Aging Research (AFAR) and President of the Academy for Health and Lifespan Research. He has also co-founded biotechnology companies (such as **CohBar, Inc.**, which develops mitochondrial therapies for age-related diseases) and **Life Biosciences**, aiming to translate insights from aging biology into therapies ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=,19)) ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=Research%20and%20AFAR%20scientific%20director,related%20disease)). Throughout a career spanning 30+ years, Barzilai has published over 270 peer-reviewed papers and earned numerous awards in aging research ([Lifeboat Foundation Bios: Dr. Nir Barzilai](https://lifeboat.com/ex/bios.nir.barzilai#:~:text=Nir%20has%20published%20more%20than,a%20reviewer%20for%20numerous%20journals)) ([Lifeboat Foundation Bios: Dr. Nir Barzilai](https://lifeboat.com/ex/bios.nir.barzilai#:~:text=He%20is%20a%20Beeson%20Fellow,trial%2C%20a%20multi)). In short, Dr. Barzilai’s background uniquely combines clinical medicine, cutting-edge genetics, and an optimistic vision for extending healthy human lifespan.

## Genetics of Exceptional Longevity: The Longevity Genes Project  
One of Barzilai’s hallmark contributions is the discovery of genetic variants that protect against age-related diseases and enable **exceptional longevity**. In studying over 600 centenarians (ages ~95–112) and their families, his team found that many had *“very high HDL cholesterol”* levels – often >100 mg/dL, far above average ([Dr. Nir Barzilai—Genetics and Lifestyle Factors of Centenarians](https://blog.insidetracker.com/longevity-by-design-nir-barzilai#:~:text=Dr,%E2%80%9D)) ([Lifeboat Foundation Bios: Dr. Nir Barzilai](https://lifeboat.com/ex/bios.nir.barzilai#:~:text=Nir%20discovered%20the%20first%20%E2%80%9Clongevity,very%20high%20levels%20of%20HDL)). This pointed to genes in cholesterol metabolism. Indeed, Barzilai **identified the first human “longevity gene”**: a variant of **CETP** (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) associated with high HDL (“good” cholesterol) and long life ([Lifeboat Foundation Bios: Dr. Nir Barzilai](https://lifeboat.com/ex/bios.nir.barzilai#:~:text=Nir%20discovered%20the%20first%20%E2%80%9Clongevity,very%20high%20levels%20of%20HDL)). He and colleagues went on to pinpoint several genetic variants enriched in centenarians, including **CETP and APOC3** (lipid metabolism genes), **ADIPOQ and the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor TSHR** (metabolic regulators), and **IGF1R** (the IGF-1 growth hormone receptor) ([Nir Barzilai - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nir_Barzilai#:~:text=by%20others.,10)) ([Lifeboat Foundation Bios: Dr. Nir Barzilai](https://lifeboat.com/ex/bios.nir.barzilai#:~:text=He%20discovered%20several%2C%20later%20independently,type%202%20diabetes%2C%20and%20dementia)). These variants appear to **protect centenarians from major age-related diseases** – reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and dementia ([Nir Barzilai - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nir_Barzilai#:~:text=and%20TSHR%20,10)) ([Lifeboat Foundation Bios: Dr. Nir Barzilai](https://lifeboat.com/ex/bios.nir.barzilai#:~:text=,type%202%20diabetes%2C%20and%20dementia)). *“Many of the centenarians had very high levels of HDL”* and unique gene profiles, Barzilai notes, which help delay pathology ([Lifeboat Foundation Bios: Dr. Nir Barzilai](https://lifeboat.com/ex/bios.nir.barzilai#:~:text=Nir%20discovered%20the%20first%20%E2%80%9Clongevity,very%20high%20levels%20of%20HDL)) ([Lifeboat Foundation Bios: Dr. Nir Barzilai](https://lifeboat.com/ex/bios.nir.barzilai#:~:text=He%20discovered%20several%2C%20later%20independently,type%202%20diabetes%2C%20and%20dementia)). 

Importantly, Barzilai’s work showed that these long-lived individuals were *not* simply health nuts or clean livers. In fact, many centenarians in his study did **not** have particularly healthy lifestyles. (*“SuperAgers don’t necessarily have healthier habits,”* he observes – some smoked or had average diets ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThey%20enjoy%20extended%20health%2C%E2%80%9D%20explains,causing%20inherited%20mutations)).) Instead, their **genomes** bestowed resilience. *“Several favorable genetic mutations appear to protect them against illness-causing mutations,”* Barzilai explains ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThey%20enjoy%20extended%20health%2C%E2%80%9D%20explains,causing%20inherited%20mutations)) ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=that%20Superagers%20don%E2%80%99t%20necessarily%20have,causing%20inherited%20mutations)). For example, a common genotype among his centenarians raises HDL and lowers triglycerides; *those with this variant not only have better heart health but also develop cancer on average 10 years later than others and avoid expected cognitive decline* ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=inherited%20mutations)) ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20Superagers%20tend%20to,disease%20as%20would%20be%20expected)). In other words, nature lent these individuals a genetic shield that slowed the usual aging process. This finding has huge implications: if we can identify the key protective genes and the pathways they influence, we might **mimic their effects in everyone**. *“Those genes can point to a mechanism that can be targeted for intervention,”* Barzilai notes – drug developers can design therapies to inhibit or stimulate those pathways ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=The%20interesting%20thing%20about%20discovering,inhibit%20or%20stimulate%20these%20genes)) ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=Through%20the%20Longevity%20Genes%20Project,impact%20other%20diseases%20as%20well)). In fact, Barzilai reports that discoveries from the Longevity Genes Project have already spurred drug development: for instance, two gene targets involved in lipid metabolism led to experimental drugs (one being a CETP inhibitor) that showed success in Phase 2 trials ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=Through%20the%20Longevity%20Genes%20Project,impact%20other%20diseases%20as%20well)). While those drugs were initially aimed at cardiovascular disease, they may impact multiple aging-related conditions ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=Through%20the%20Longevity%20Genes%20Project,impact%20other%20diseases%20as%20well)) ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=to%20the%20development%20of%20a,impact%20other%20diseases%20as%20well)).

Beyond blood lipids, Barzilai’s centenarian research highlighted other biological hallmarks. One notable finding involves the **growth hormone/IGF-1 pathway**. Centenarians often have genetically lower activity in IGF-1 (a hormone related to growth and aging) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=The%20Einstein%20team%20has%20identified%2C,mitochondrial%20proteins%20that%20may%20protect)). *“They have a genetic variant that down-regulates IGF-1,”* Barzilai explains ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=The%20Einstein%20team%20has%20identified%2C,mitochondrial%20proteins%20that%20may%20protect)). This echoes animal studies where reduced IGF-1 signaling extended lifespan (famously, dwarf mice with low growth hormone live longer) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=The%20study%20of%20the%20Bronx,much%20smaller%E2%80%94but%20lived%20much%20longer)). Barzilai examined data from the UK Biobank and found a striking pattern: *high IGF-1 activity is beneficial when you’re young, but in old age it’s the opposite* ([Dr. Nir Barzilai—Genetics and Lifestyle Factors of Centenarians](https://blog.insidetracker.com/longevity-by-design-nir-barzilai#:~:text=Interestingly%2C%20growth%20hormones%20may%20also,you%27re%20old%2C%20it%27s%20the%20opposite)). Elderly women with the **lowest IGF-1 levels lived twice as long** as those with the highest levels ([Dr. Nir Barzilai—Genetics and Lifestyle Factors of Centenarians](https://blog.insidetracker.com/longevity-by-design-nir-barzilai#:~:text=you%27re%20young%2C%20it%20protects%20you,you%27re%20old%2C%20it%27s%20the%20opposite)). This suggests that dialing down growth signals in later life might promote longevity – a clue consistent with centenarians’ genetics. It also serves as a caution against growth hormone as an anti-aging therapy. As Barzilai puts it, *when you’re old, more growth hormone/IGF-1 can actually be harmful rather than helpful* ([Dr. Nir Barzilai—Genetics and Lifestyle Factors of Centenarians](https://blog.insidetracker.com/longevity-by-design-nir-barzilai#:~:text=Interestingly%2C%20growth%20hormones%20may%20also,you%27re%20old%2C%20it%27s%20the%20opposite)).

Barzilai and collaborators also discovered centenarian families have unusual levels of certain **mitochondrial peptides**. One such molecule is **humanin**, produced in the mitochondria. Centenarians’ offspring had higher humanin levels, which may protect cells from aging damage ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=The%20Einstein%20team%20has%20identified%2C,mitochondrial%20proteins%20that%20may%20protect)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=centenarians%20more%20often%20carry%20a,or%20SHLPs)). Barzilai (with colleague Pinchas Cohen) humorously dubbed a whole class of these peptides “**Schleps**” – *small humanin-like peptides* – and they suspect these might confer resistance to metabolic and oxidative stress ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=The%20Einstein%20team%20has%20identified%2C,mitochondrial%20proteins%20that%20may%20protect)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=growth%2C%20but%20also%20has%20been,or%20SHLPs)). Barzilai even co-founded CohBar to develop mitochondrial-based therapeutics, inspired by these findings ([Nir Barzilai - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nir_Barzilai#:~:text=their%20genetic%20homogeneity%2C%20which%20makes,treat%20diseases%20associated%20with%20aging)) ([Nir Barzilai - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nir_Barzilai#:~:text=Treatments%20for%20age,found)).

### Personality, Stress, and Other Factors  
Interestingly, Dr. Barzilai’s studies have also noted **psychosocial traits** among centenarians. In a 2012 study, he found that many centenarians share certain personality characteristics – often being positive, easygoing, outgoing, and able to handle stress well ([Centenarians' Positive Attitude Linked to Long Life](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/news/story/centenarians-positive-attitude-linked-long-healthy-life-16494151?userab=shop_ui_series-292%2Avariant_b_cta-green-cta-full-1148#:~:text=Centenarians%27%20Positive%20Attitude%20Linked%20to,They%20developed%20a)). Barzilai has observed firsthand that *“personality and outlook on life are particularly striking”* in these elders ([Dr. Nir Barzilai—Genetics and Lifestyle Factors of Centenarians](https://blog.insidetracker.com/longevity-by-design-nir-barzilai#:~:text=As%20a%20scientist%20who%20has,He%27s%20really%20wonderful)) ([Dr. Nir Barzilai—Genetics and Lifestyle Factors of Centenarians](https://blog.insidetracker.com/longevity-by-design-nir-barzilai#:~:text=insightful,He%27s%20really%20wonderful)). They tend to emphasize the good and let go of the bad. He recalls a 100-year-old participant: *“He is thoughtful… thinks his son is great, and thinks his daughter-in-law cannot do wrong. He’s really wonderful.”* ([Dr. Nir Barzilai—Genetics and Lifestyle Factors of Centenarians](https://blog.insidetracker.com/longevity-by-design-nir-barzilai#:~:text=insightful,He%27s%20really%20wonderful)) Such optimistic, forgiving attitudes may contribute to emotional resilience. Barzilai concludes that *mindset is everything*. *“Old people are very interested in being happy, and it doesn’t take a lot to make them happy,”* he says, contrasting centenarians with the young: *“In young people, you need five things to make them happy for every bad thing. In the elderly, you only need one or two things to make them happy.”* ([Dr. Nir Barzilai—Genetics and Lifestyle Factors of Centenarians](https://blog.insidetracker.com/longevity-by-design-nir-barzilai#:~:text=He%20goes%20on%20to%20show,things%20to%20make%20them%20happy)) This positive mental outlook – finding joy in small things and retaining purpose – could itself be a longevity factor. Indeed, other researchers have noted lower rates of depression and neuroticism in centenarians, and Barzilai’s work suggests that **strong social ties and a sense of humor** often go hand-in-hand with long life ([Centenarians' Positive Attitude Linked to Long Life](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/news/story/centenarians-positive-attitude-linked-long-healthy-life-16494151?userab=shop_ui_series-292%2Avariant_b_cta-green-cta-full-1148#:~:text=Centenarians%27%20Positive%20Attitude%20Linked%20to,They%20developed%20a)). Barzilai has remarked that many of his centenarians enjoy robust social support and continue to find meaning in life even at 100+.

In summary, Barzilai’s research on centenarians has yielded two key insights: **(1)** Exceptional longevity often has a **genetic basis** – specific gene variants can slow aging and fend off diseases – and **(2)** **Lifestyle factors** alone are not the full story, yet psychological resilience and social engagement do appear to be common among the very old. These findings have laid the groundwork for Barzilai’s next quest: translating longevity science into therapies that can help everyone *“age later.”*

## Targeting Aging with Metformin: The TAME Trial  
Perhaps the most high-profile initiative led by Dr. Barzilai is the effort to formally **test a drug to slow aging** – specifically, the diabetes medication **metformin**. Barzilai spearheads the planned **Targeting Aging with Metformin (TAME) trial**, which aims to prove that treating aging itself can delay multiple diseases. *“We think this is a groundbreaking, perhaps paradigm-shifting trial,”* said one collaborator ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=The%20man%20who%20wants%20to,beat%20back%20aging)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=On%20a%20blazingly%20hot%20morning,the%20process%20of%20human%20aging)). The idea is bold: recruit ~3,000 older adults (ages 65–79), give half of them metformin and half placebo, and track them for ~5–6 years to see if the metformin group develops **age-related diseases** later than the placebo group ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=Then%20he%20proceeded%20to%20lay,it%20comes%20to%20these%20diseases)) ([Cheap longevity drug? Researchers aim to test if metformin can slow down aging : Shots - Health News : NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/22/1245872510/a-cheap-drug-may-slow-down-aging-a-study-will-determine-if-it-works#:~:text=The%20aim%20is%20to%20enroll,he%20says)). Instead of testing one drug for one disease (the usual clinical trial model), TAME will measure a composite outcome – the time until a participant develops any of several major age-related chronic diseases (e.g. heart attack, stroke, cancer, dementia) or dies ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=elderly%20people%3B%20half%20would%20get,of%20the%20other%20factors%20combined)). As Barzilai often points out, *“aging is a bigger risk factor than all of the other factors combined”* for those diseases ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=standard%E2%80%94whether%20it%20could%20delay%20the,of%20the%20other%20factors%20combined)). By slowing the biological aging process, even modestly, one could theoretically prevent or postpone many illnesses at once – *“the ultimate in preventive medicine,”* as colleague Steven Austad put it ([Cheap longevity drug? Researchers aim to test if metformin can slow down aging : Shots - Health News : NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/22/1245872510/a-cheap-drug-may-slow-down-aging-a-study-will-determine-if-it-works#:~:text=Sponsor%20Message)) ([Cheap longevity drug?

### Why Metformin?  
Metformin is a generic, decades-old drug for type 2 diabetes, so on the surface it’s an unlikely “fountain of youth.” But Barzilai saw compelling reasons to choose it as the first anti-aging test case. Metformin has an extensive safety record (used by millions since the 1960s) and costs mere cents a dose ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=by%20almost%20any%20standard%20of,unlikely%20to%20be%20an%20issue)). Equally important, studies hinted that metformin confers broad health benefits beyond blood sugar control. Epidemiological data showed diabetic patients on metformin had lower rates of cardiovascular disease, cancer, cognitive decline, and even **lived longer than non-diabetics** ([Nir Barzilai - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nir_Barzilai#:~:text=,17)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=Epidemiological%20studies%20have%20also%20suggested,matched%20controls)). In one striking analysis of over 78,000 people in their 60s, British researchers found *diabetics taking metformin actually outlived healthy peers* of the same age ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=Epidemiological%20studies%20have%20also%20suggested,matched%20controls)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=although%20observational%2C%20got%20the%20attention,matched%20controls)). *“Human studies show that metformin can extend lifespan and healthspan,”* Barzilai notes, with evidence for reduced cancer, heart disease, cognitive decline, and mortality risk ([Dr. Nir Barzilai—Genetics and Lifestyle Factors of Centenarians](https://blog.insidetracker.com/longevity-by-design-nir-barzilai#:~:text=Metformin%20is%20a%20drug%20best,agent%20that%20can%20delay%20aging)) ([Dr. Nir Barzilai—Genetics and Lifestyle Factors of Centenarians](https://blog.insidetracker.com/longevity-by-design-nir-barzilai#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHuman%20studies%20show%20that%20Metformin,%E2%80%9D)). These tantalizing associations don’t prove cause and effect – metformin’s effects in non-diabetics remain unproven – but they align with biology. Metformin impacts fundamental aging pathways: it lowers insulin and IGF-1 signaling, dampens inflammation, improves metabolic and mitochondrial function, and activates cellular clean-up processes like autophagy ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=None%20of%20these%20studies%20proves,see%20graphic%2C%20below)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=Pollak%20has%20demonstrated%20what%20he,is%20going%20to%20last%20longer)). In short, it hits many of the “hallmarks of aging” simultaneously. Barzilai often uses an analogy that running our cellular “furnace” a bit cooler (as metformin does by inhibiting mitochondrial energy output) could make it last longer ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=Pollak%20has%20demonstrated%20what%20he,is%20going%20to%20last%20longer)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=mitochondria%2C%20in%20effect%20turning%20down,is%20going%20to%20last%20longer)). *“When you keep your house at a lower temperature, your furnace is going to last longer,”* explains Dr. Michael Pollak, describing metformin’s effect on cell metabolism ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=and%20metabolism%20%28see%20graphic%2C%20below%29)).

Equally crucial in Barzilai’s choice was **safety**. Some geroscientists felt more potent anti-aging drugs existed – for example, **rapamycin**, an immune-suppressant that in animal tests **extends mouse lifespan by 20-30%** (the “most spectacular” result so far) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=compounds%20that%20might%20alter%20or,Sierra)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=the%20proposed%20trial)). Austad admitted, *“Rapamycin would have been my first choice, because the animal results have been so spectacular.”* But Barzilai insisted they start with a gentler option: *“We can’t afford in this first trial to kill anybody,”* he told colleagues ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=the%20proposed%20trial)). Metformin’s side effects are well-known and generally mild (mainly digestive upset in some users, which can be managed) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=As%20it%20turns%20out%2C%20Barzilai,to%20the%20proposed%20trial)). By contrast, rapamycin can increase infection risk and has less human safety data in healthy people. Strategically, Barzilai argued, the first-ever aging trial **must succeed safely** to pave the way. His colleagues agreed that he was right *“strategically”* ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=the%20proposed%20trial)). As Barzilai quipped, *“We chose metformin in order not to talk about it anymore.”* In other words, the goal is not to champion this particular drug but to **prove the principle** that targeting aging works ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=enter%20the%20field)). *Metformin is for us a tool – a very exciting tool… It’ll work, I think. But I don’t want to waste the hour talking about metformin,”* he said, emphasizing the broader mission ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=enter%20the%20field)).

### Regulatory Hurdles and the FDA Meeting  
Convincing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to green-light a trial for “aging” was initially a challenge. Aging itself isn’t recognized as a disease by regulators, and “anti-aging” has a snake-oil stigma ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=explain%20the%20rationale%20for%20the,aging.%22%20His%20colleagues%20pounced)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=But%20the%20phrase%20%22anti,Third%20time%2C%20the%20death%20penalty)). Barzilai and colleagues were careful to avoid that term. They framed TAME as targeting **“multiple comorbidities”** – essentially treating aging as the common risk factor behind diseases ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=Barzilai%20now%20believes%20the%20answer,if%20I%20can%20delay%20it)). *“Basically, I think the FDA will be more willing to accept something called ‘comorbidities’ than… ‘aging’,”* Barzilai noted ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=Barzilai%20now%20believes%20the%20answer,if%20I%20can%20delay%20it)). He even acknowledges philosophically, *“In my mind, aging is not a disease… it’s humanity! You’re born, you die, you age in between. I don’t care what they want to call it, if I can delay it.”* ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=chronic%20diseases%20whose%20incidence%20rises,if%20I%20can%20delay%20it)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=than%20it%20is%20to%20accept,if%20I%20can%20delay%20it)). This pragmatic approach worked. In 2015, Barzilai’s team met with FDA officials and emerged optimistic: *“I don’t think it could have gone much better,”* reported one scientist, giving two thumbs-up ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=When%20he%20and%20the%20rest,he%20said)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=The%20meeting%20ran%20nearly%2030,he%20said)). The FDA indicated they were **open to the trial** design, even if cautious on details, recognizing the potential value of a drug to *“improve quality of life and survival”* by targeting aging or multi-morbidities ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=,details%2C%20yes)). Essentially, Barzilai won a tacit blessing: the agency signaled it would not oppose TAME, so long as the protocol was sound ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=Sandy%20Walsh%2C%20an%20FDA%20spokeswoman%2C,the%20idea%20of%20a%20trial)). This was a historic milestone – it meant aging could be tested as an **indication**. *Barzilai described the meeting as “historical” (if humorously typo’ed as “hysterical” in his excited email) because “I think in their heart, they buy it… the important people are buying what we are saying.”* ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=Barzilai%2C%20whose%20enthusiasm%20occasionally%20exceeds,the%20group%20is%20now%20making)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=thanking%20them%20and%20describing%20the,the%20group%20is%20now%20making)). Securing FDA buy-in was critical to opening the door for future geroprotective drugs, often called the “longevity dividend” strategy ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=The%20comorbidity%20strategy%20is%20key,Olshansky)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=not%20arguing%E2%80%94and%20we%27ve%20never%20argued%E2%80%94that,the%20period%20of%20healthy%20life)). If TAME can show success, it would *“set a precedent”* and encourage pharmaceutical investment into true anti-aging therapies ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=Barzilai%20concedes%20that%20he%20and,pharma%20to%20enter%20the%20field)). As S. Jay Olshansky stated, *“What we’re talking about here is a fundamental sea change in how we look at aging and disease… The goal is the extension of the period of healthy life.”* ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=The%20group%27s%20paranoia%20about%20the,the%20nonprofit%20AFAR%2C%20not%20a)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=idea%20is%20that%20slowing%20down,the%20period%20of%20healthy%20life)).

### Current Status of TAME and Funding Challenges  
Although scientifically and conceptually ready, the TAME trial has faced **funding hurdles**. As of 2024, the full ~$65 million needed had not been secured ([Why is the TAME trial taking so long to even start? : r/longevity - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/longevity/comments/1cl7x60/why_is_the_tame_trial_taking_so_long_to_even_start/#:~:text=Why%20is%20the%20TAME%20trial,as%20far%20as%20trials%20go)) ([Cheap longevity drug?

No patent means little profit motive, so industry hasn’t stepped up. Barzilai has turned to philanthropy: AFAR and private donors. The NIH’s National Institute on Aging has earmarked about $5 million, but that’s only a fraction of what’s needed ([Cheap longevity drug? Researchers aim to test if metformin can slow down aging : Shots - Health News : NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/22/1245872510/a-cheap-drug-may-slow-down-aging-a-study-will-determine-if-it-works#:~:text=match%20at%20L275%20Barzilai%20has,cost%20between%20%2445%20and%20%2470)) ([Cheap longevity drug?

It is frustrating, Barzilai says, because the payoff could be huge for public health: *“If the trial [proves] protective effects, millions of people could benefit. It’s something everybody will be able to afford.”* ([Cheap longevity drug? Researchers aim to test if metformin can slow down aging : Shots - Health News : NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/22/1245872510/a-cheap-drug-may-slow-down-aging-a-study-will-determine-if-it-works#:~:text=million)) ([Cheap longevity drug?

This would *“usher in a paradigm shift — from treating each age-related condition separately, to treating these conditions together by targeting aging itself.”* ([Cheap longevity drug? Researchers aim to test if metformin can slow down aging : Shots - Health News : NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/22/1245872510/a-cheap-drug-may-slow-down-aging-a-study-will-determine-if-it-works#:~:text=The%20frustration%20over%20the%20lack,Barzilai%20says)).

He actively campaigns for support, often joking that he’s waiting for a wealthy benefactor’s call: *“Somebody [very rich] will call me one day and say: ‘I don’t mind helping. Is $50 million enough?’ And then we’ll get going.”* ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=Now%2C%20trial%20advocates%20need%20someone,rich%20like%20I%20don%27t%20know)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=group%20has%20already%20targeted%20,And%20then%20we%27ll%20get%20going)).

In the meantime, anecdotal off-label use of metformin for longevity has grown, and Barzilai finds himself giving both encouragement and caution. He emphasizes that **TAME’s goal is to get solid evidence** so doctors can confidently prescribe an age-slowing drug in the future. Until then, he understands some older adults may choose metformin based on current evidence. In fact, Barzilai has candidly shared that *he and his wife both take metformin* in their 60s, and he even started it years ago when he was prediabetic ([Metformin As Anti-Aging Drug: Side Effects, Risks, Scientific Advice - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/metformin-diabetes-weight-loss-anti-aging-drug-long-covid-prevention-2023-2#:~:text=Barzilai%20himself%20believes%20that%20for,effects%20on%20testosterone%20and%20muscle)) ([Metformin As Anti-Aging Drug: Side Effects, Risks, Scientific Advice - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/metformin-diabetes-weight-loss-anti-aging-drug-long-covid-prevention-2023-2#:~:text=But%20when%20it%20comes%20to,his%20wife%20take%20it%20regularly)). Now slim and no longer prediabetic, he continues it because *“the evidence is, in my mind, so overwhelming.”* ([Metformin As Anti-Aging Drug: Side Effects, Risks, Scientific Advice - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/metformin-diabetes-weight-loss-anti-aging-drug-long-covid-prevention-2023-2#:~:text=These%20days%2C%20Barzilai%20is%20leaner,helping%20people%20stay%20healthier%2C%20longer)) ([Metformin As Anti-Aging Drug: Side Effects, Risks, Scientific Advice - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/metformin-diabetes-weight-loss-anti-aging-drug-long-covid-prevention-2023-2#:~:text=,in%20my%20mind%2C%20so%20overwhelming)). He also routinely advises his older friends and family to ask their doctors about metformin’s potential benefits *now*, rather than waiting a decade ([Metformin As Anti-Aging Drug: Side Effects, Risks, Scientific Advice - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/metformin-diabetes-weight-loss-anti-aging-drug-long-covid-prevention-2023-2#:~:text=Barzilai%20himself%20believes%20that%20for,effects%20on%20testosterone%20and%20muscle)) ([Metformin As Anti-Aging Drug: Side Effects, Risks, Scientific Advice - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/metformin-diabetes-weight-loss-anti-aging-drug-long-covid-prevention-2023-2#:~:text=But%20when%20it%20comes%20to,his%20wife%20take%20it%20regularly)). This reflects Barzilai’s personal opinion – based on existing observational studies – that for people already **in the aging process** (say over 65 or with aging-related conditions), metformin’s upside likely outweighs the downsides. *For these individuals, Barzilai believes metformin can act as a “prophylactic for aging,” helping people stay healthier, longer* ([Metformin As Anti-Aging Drug: Side Effects, Risks, Scientific Advice - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/metformin-diabetes-weight-loss-anti-aging-drug-long-covid-prevention-2023-2#:~:text=These%20days%2C%20Barzilai%20is%20leaner,helping%20people%20stay%20healthier%2C%20longer)) ([Metformin As Anti-Aging Drug: Side Effects, Risks, Scientific Advice - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/metformin-diabetes-weight-loss-anti-aging-drug-long-covid-prevention-2023-2#:~:text=of%20Medicine%20in%20New%20York%2C,helping%20people%20stay%20healthier%2C%20longer)).

However, Barzilai strongly **warns against younger, healthy people casually taking metformin** for longevity. He has been vocal on this point, labeling it a misuse of current knowledge. *“I am horrified to learn that young people (<40) without diabetes would consider taking metformin for longevity,”* he tweeted in early 2023 ([4 Risks of Supplements and Medication for Longevity and Antiaging](https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-anti-aging-supplements-risks-2023-12#:~:text=4%20Risks%20of%20Supplements%20and,Nir%20Barzilai%2C%20the%20founding)) ([Metformin As Anti-Aging Drug: Side Effects, Risks, Scientific Advice - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/metformin-diabetes-weight-loss-anti-aging-drug-long-covid-prevention-2023-2#:~:text=Barzilai%20himself%20believes%20that%20for,effects%20on%20testosterone%20and%20muscle)). His reasoning: we don’t yet know if benefits extend to that group, and there are concerns such as metformin’s effect on muscle and fertility in the young. Indeed, metformin can slightly lower testosterone and has been shown to **inhibit some of the muscle growth gains from exercise** ([Metformin As Anti-Aging Drug: Side Effects, Risks, Scientific Advice - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/metformin-diabetes-weight-loss-anti-aging-drug-long-covid-prevention-2023-2#:~:text=acid%20buildup%20in%20the%20bloodstream,the%20risk%20of%20birth%20defects)) ([Metformin As Anti-Aging Drug: Side Effects, Risks, Scientific Advice - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/metformin-diabetes-weight-loss-anti-aging-drug-long-covid-prevention-2023-2#:~:text=Barzilai%20himself%20believes%20that%20for,effects%20on%20testosterone%20and%20muscle)). One study found adults over 65 on metformin had a harder time building muscle mass from resistance training ([Cheap longevity drug?

He echoes concerns that while you’re young and still building fitness or family, metformin’s downsides (like blunted muscle response or a small risk of B12 deficiency) could outweigh any long-term preventive benefit ([Metformin As Anti-Aging Drug: Side Effects, Risks, Scientific Advice - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/metformin-diabetes-weight-loss-anti-aging-drug-long-covid-prevention-2023-2#:~:text=acid%20buildup%20in%20the%20bloodstream,the%20risk%20of%20birth%20defects)) ([Metformin As Anti-Aging Drug: Side Effects, Risks, Scientific Advice - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/metformin-diabetes-weight-loss-anti-aging-drug-long-covid-prevention-2023-2#:~:text=Barzilai%20himself%20believes%20that%20for,effects%20on%20testosterone%20and%20muscle)). In Barzilai’s view, **off-label metformin for longevity should be limited to those truly at risk from aging** – e.g. older adults or those with prediabetes – until trials prove otherwise ([Metformin As Anti-Aging Drug: Side Effects, Risks, Scientific Advice - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/metformin-diabetes-weight-loss-anti-aging-drug-long-covid-prevention-2023-2#:~:text=Barzilai%20himself%20believes%20that%20for,effects%20on%20testosterone%20and%20muscle)). As fellow longevity researcher Matteo Quarta advises, people should *“be careful until we have done the studies to prove or disprove that metformin can be beneficial, and who can benefit… in which conditions.”* ([Metformin As Anti-Aging Drug: Side Effects, Risks, Scientific Advice - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/metformin-diabetes-weight-loss-anti-aging-drug-long-covid-prevention-2023-2#:~:text=,Quarta%20said)). Barzilai shares this prudent stance for the young, even as he pushes forward to get the definitive answers.

### Metformin’s Promise and Skeptics  
Despite some skepticism in the medical community, Barzilai’s advocacy has helped change the conversation about aging. Many clinicians and even “well-heeled doctors” have begun to take metformin preventively, impressed by the data ([Metformin As Anti-Aging Drug: Side Effects, Risks, Scientific Advice - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/metformin-diabetes-weight-loss-anti-aging-drug-long-covid-prevention-2023-2#:~:text=For%20all%20these%20reasons%2C%20metformin,now%20taking%20the%20drug%2C%20too)). Still, others caution that only a randomized trial like TAME can provide proof. Barzilai acknowledges that *“None of these studies [so far] proves that metformin will delay age-associated diseases,”* and that more research is needed ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=adult%20type%202%20diabetics%20in,matched%20controls)). The exact mechanisms by which metformin might slow aging are still being studied, though multiple are known (e.g. AMPK activation, mTOR inhibition, reducing insulin levels, lowering reactive oxygen species) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=None%20of%20these%20studies%20proves,see%20graphic%2C%20below)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=Pollak%20has%20demonstrated%20what%20he,is%20going%20to%20last%20longer)). Barzilai often finds himself explaining *“how one drug has so many actions.”* The reason, he says, is that **metformin targets fundamental aging processes**: *“Metformin targets all of the hallmarks of aging. When you fix one hallmark of aging, others are affected as well… it shifts metabolic outcomes, and can even prevent some oxidative damage and reduce inflammation.”* ([Dr. Nir Barzilai—Genetics and Lifestyle Factors of Centenarians](https://blog.insidetracker.com/longevity-by-design-nir-barzilai#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHuman%20studies%20show%20that%20Metformin,%E2%80%9D)) ([Dr. Nir Barzilai—Genetics and Lifestyle Factors of Centenarians](https://blog.insidetracker.com/longevity-by-design-nir-barzilai#:~:text=Dr,oxidative%20damage%20and%20reduce%20inflammation)). In other words, aging pathways are interconnected – tweak one, you influence the others, and thus one drug can impact many age-related conditions.

Some experts, like Dr. Eric Verdin of the Buck Institute, have noted a potential trade-off with metformin: *“There’s some evidence that people who exercise and are on metformin have less gain in muscle mass… That could be a concern for people who are under-muscled.”* ([Cheap longevity drug? Researchers aim to test if metformin can slow down aging : Shots - Health News : NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/22/1245872510/a-cheap-drug-may-slow-down-aging-a-study-will-determine-if-it-works#:~:text=experienced%20any%20negative%20side%20effects)) ([Cheap longevity drug?

This is a valid concern for frail older adults who need muscle strength. Barzilai’s answer is that such issues might be managed (e.g. timing metformin dose away from workouts, ensuring protein intake, or combining metformin with another drug to counteract muscle effects). In fact, combinations are already being explored – for example, metformin plus **galantamine** is being investigated to combat sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss) ([Cheap longevity drug? Researchers aim to test if metformin can slow down aging : Shots - Health News : NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/22/1245872510/a-cheap-drug-may-slow-down-aging-a-study-will-determine-if-it-works#:~:text=But%20Verdin%20says%20it%20may,related%20muscle%20loss)) ([Cheap longevity drug?

And significantly, **no one believes metformin is the final word** in anti-aging medicine. *“Nobody thinks this is the be all and end all of drugs that target aging,”* Austad emphasizes ([Cheap longevity drug? Researchers aim to test if metformin can slow down aging : Shots - Health News : NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/22/1245872510/a-cheap-drug-may-slow-down-aging-a-study-will-determine-if-it-works#:~:text=,he%20says)). Rather, TAME is viewed as the opening move. If it succeeds, it will *“stimulate investment by big pharma… They may come up with much better drugs,”* Austad says ([Cheap longevity drug? Researchers aim to test if metformin can slow down aging : Shots - Health News : NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/22/1245872510/a-cheap-drug-may-slow-down-aging-a-study-will-determine-if-it-works#:~:text=,he%20says)) ([Cheap longevity drug?

Barzilai concurs – his broader mission is to **prove that aging can be treated**, thereby legitimizing an entire category of geroprotective drugs. In his own colorful words, at this point *“I’m feeling the FDA is really a pain in the butt”* ([Metformin As Anti-Aging Drug: Side Effects, Risks, Scientific Advice - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/metformin-diabetes-weight-loss-anti-aging-drug-long-covid-prevention-2023-2#:~:text=their%20doctors%20about%20metformin%20now,his%20wife%20take%20it%20regularly)) for moving slowly; he is impatient to get on with implementing what he calls not just a hope but a **“promise”** for healthier aging ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=I%20always%20say%20that%20a,but%20against%20the%20next%20pathogen)) ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=that%20can%20do%20this%20in,but%20against%20the%20next%20pathogen)).

## Beyond Metformin: Barzilai’s Views on Other Longevity Interventions  
While metformin and longevity genes have been Barzilai’s signature areas, he is well-versed in the spectrum of aging interventions – from lifestyle measures like diet and exercise to other drugs and experimental therapies. In interviews and writings (including his 2020 book *Age Later*), he often discusses a **portfolio of strategies** that can extend healthspan. 

**Caloric Restriction and Fasting:** Barzilai frequently highlights the evidence from animal models that **caloric restriction (CR)** can dramatically extend lifespan in species from worms to mice. However, severe CR is not practical for most humans. Instead, Barzilai is “excited about” research into **intermittent fasting** and time-restricted feeding, which may capture some benefits of CR in a feasible way ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=Eat%20less)). He practices what he preaches: Barzilai personally follows a 16:8 **intermittent fasting regimen**, fasting ~16 hours each day and eating only in an 8-hour window ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=degeneration%20and%20works%20on%20balance,and%20flexibility)). *He reports “improved… exercise capacity” and other markers since adopting this routine,* noting that some of his own aging-related metrics have improved with fasting ([Dr. Nir Barzilai—Genetics and Lifestyle Factors of Centenarians](https://blog.insidetracker.com/longevity-by-design-nir-barzilai#:~:text=in%20being%20happy%2C%20and%20it,things%20to%20make%20them%20happy)). In Barzilai’s view, moderate fasting “seems to extend the lifespans of animals” and likely helps human metabolic health as well ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=Eat%20less)). It’s a low-tech intervention that influences many of the same pathways (insulin/IGF, autophagy) that drugs like metformin target. Thus, he advises those able to try time-restricted eating or skipping meals as a way to potentially **delay aging processes**.

**Nutrition and Diet Quality:** Aside from fasting, Barzilai advocates a balanced, moderate diet. Unlike some longevity pundits, he doesn’t push any extreme or faddish diet. Instead, he emphasizes **not overeating** (calories in general) and maintaining metabolic health. For example, in his own life he avoids excessive refined carbs and ensures a nutritious diet during his eating window ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=Eat%20less)). He has acknowledged the value of certain dietary patterns observed in long-lived populations (like the plant-rich “Blue Zone” diets), but also notes that his centenarians often *did not strictly follow* such diets. This reinforces his focus on moderation and genetics over any “longevity diet” magic. That said, Barzilai has mentioned specific nutrients in context of aging research – e.g. **resveratrol**, a compound in red wine that mimics CR in some animals. Interestingly, large studies (including the NIA’s Interventions Testing Program) found resveratrol had *no significant impact* on mouse lifespan ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=compounds%20that%20might%20alter%20or,Sierra)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=herbal%20compound%20derived%20from%20the,ballyhooed%20red)). Barzilai uses such findings to caution against hype; he stresses that rigorous testing is needed for each purported anti-aging supplement. 

**Exercise and Physical Activity:** If there is one intervention Barzilai endorses as much as metformin, it is **exercise**. *“Go a little farther every day,”* he advises ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=Step%20out)). Barzilai notes that **regular exercise is perhaps the most evidence-backed way to extend healthspan** – it improves cardiovascular health, maintains muscle, sharpens the mind, and even correlates with lower mortality risk. In his personal routine, Barzilai **walks at least 10,000 steps daily** and encourages others to stay active in any way they enjoy ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=Step%20out)). *He also strength trains once a week to prevent age-related muscle loss*, and incorporates balance and flexibility exercises ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=Step%20out)). This blend of aerobic activity, resistance training, and balance work aligns with standard recommendations for healthy aging. Barzilai emphasizes consistency over intensity: even moderate activity, accumulated day by day, pays dividends in the long run. His key message is to **avoid sedentariness**. For older adults especially, maintaining muscle mass and mobility is critical. This is one reason he is wary of anything (even metformin) that could undermine exercise benefits in frail elders – muscle is literally life-saving in old age. Barzilai sometimes jokes that if there were a pill that could capture exercise’s effects, it would be a miracle drug; since there isn’t, *staying physically active is one of the best “anti-aging medicines” we already have* (a view widely shared in gerontology).

**Sleep and Stress Management:** Barzilai places high value on **adequate sleep** as a pillar of healthy longevity. He makes sure to get about **7 hours of sleep each night**, aiming for quality rest ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=Sleep%20more)). *“Getting enough sleep helps prevent sleep-related diseases and improves mental performance,”* he notes ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=Sleep%20more)). Chronic sleep deprivation is linked to numerous issues (diabetes, cognitive decline, etc.), so Barzilai considers sleep part of one’s longevity toolkit. He has also observed that centenarians tend to handle stress well. Many have a relaxed, easygoing attitude. Barzilai often recounts how his centenarian subjects seemed to let frustrations roll off their backs and focused on positive aspects of life ([Dr. Nir Barzilai—Genetics and Lifestyle Factors of Centenarians](https://blog.insidetracker.com/longevity-by-design-nir-barzilai#:~:text=He%20goes%20on%20to%20show,things%20to%20make%20them%20happy)). **Managing stress** and maintaining a positive outlook, he suggests, can influence hormonal and immune factors that impact aging. While this is hard to quantify, Barzilai believes *happiness and emotional resilience are essentially protective* – a finding backed by studies linking positive psychological traits to longevity ([Centenarians' Positive Attitude Linked to Long Life](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/news/story/centenarians-positive-attitude-linked-long-healthy-life-16494151?userab=shop_ui_series-292%2Avariant_b_cta-green-cta-full-1148#:~:text=Centenarians%27%20Positive%20Attitude%20Linked%20to,They%20developed%20a)). Thus, he encourages finding healthy ways to de-stress, whether through meditation, socializing, hobbies, or therapy.

**Social Connections and Purpose:** Barzilai is a big proponent of staying socially and intellectually engaged as one ages. In *Age Later*, he writes about the importance of **finding purpose in life** and nurturing relationships ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=Think%20holistically)). Having a reason to get up in the morning – be it work, volunteering, family, or a passion project – can motivate people to take care of their health and persevere through challenges. Likewise, **social bonds** provide emotional support and cognitive stimulation. Loneliness and isolation, on the other hand, are associated with worse health and shorter life. Barzilai cites the example of centenarians who remain embedded in family and community networks; many continue to mentor others or share wisdom, reinforcing their sense of purpose. In his own life, Barzilai is deeply engaged with a global community of scientists, students, and policy-makers, which no doubt gives him a strong sense of mission. He often stresses that *aging is not just biological but also social – staying connected can keep you young at heart.* In practical terms, Barzilai recommends older adults make efforts to **maintain friendships, join groups, volunteer, or at least regularly interact with loved ones** ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=Think%20holistically)). This is part of what he calls a “holistic” approach to aging well.

**Preventive Medicine:** Another concrete recommendation Barzilai gives is to utilize simple preventive health measures. For instance, he urges older individuals to **get their annual flu vaccine** (and other appropriate immunizations) ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=Think%20holistically)). Why? Because diseases like influenza can be disproportionately deadly in the elderly, and anything that knocks down avoidable illness removes a stressor that can accelerate aging. This became even more salient during the COVID-19 pandemic. Barzilai pointed out that those who survived COVID at advanced ages often were people with robust underlying health (sometimes due to genetics) ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=The%20disproportionate%20impact%20of%20COVID,centenarians%2C%20who%20survive%20the%20virus)) ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=On%20a%20cellular%20level%2C%20these,these%20hallmarks%20at%20lower%20levels)). He believes boosting immunity – whether through vaccines or potential geroprotective drugs – is key to helping more older adults resist novel pathogens. In interviews, he highlighted that *metformin users had lower COVID-19 mortality*, suggesting aging-targeted treatments could improve immune function ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20metformin%20is%20a,and%20those%20in%20the%20future)) ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20metformin%20is%20a,and%20those%20in%20the%20future)). But until such therapies are standard, basic preventative care (vaccinations, regular check-ups, controlling blood pressure, etc.) is vital to extend one’s healthy years. Barzilai’s stance is essentially that we should **use all available tools** – lifestyle, preventive medicine, and (when proven safe) pharmacological interventions – to maximize our healthspan.

## Philosophical and Ethical Perspectives on Aging and Well-Being  
Dr. Barzilai’s outlook on aging is fundamentally optimistic yet pragmatic. He often says that *“a future of healthy aging is not just a hope, but a promise.”* ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=Advertisement)) ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=I%20always%20say%20that%20a,but%20against%20the%20next%20pathogen)) In other words, he is confident that science will deliver interventions to markedly improve late-life health in the near future. This optimism is grounded in the progress he’s witnessed in biogerontology over the past decades – what once sounded like science fiction (slowing aging) is now a tangible research goal. Barzilai sees himself and his colleagues as working to fulfill this “promise” for society. The **goal is not immortality or extreme lifespan**, but rather **more years of healthy, functional life** for as many people as possible. *“My book may be called *Age Later*, but it really could be called *Healthier Longer*,”* he says, underscoring that the aim is to compress morbidity and extend vitality, not just add years of frailty ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=The%20TAME%20Trial%20seeks%20an,promising%20therapies%20to%20extend%20health)). *“The promise that we all can live healthier for longer as we grow older and decrease the pain of disease and illness is really what motivates me and my inspiring colleagues in the field,”* Barzilai affirms ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=The%20TAME%20Trial%20seeks%20an,promising%20therapies%20to%20extend%20health)) ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=extend%20health)). This reflects a humanitarian drive – aging research, to him, is about improving quality of life (happiness, independence, productivity) for older adults, and reducing the burden of age-related diseases on individuals, families, and healthcare systems.

Barzilai often references the **“longevity dividend”** – the idea that even a small slowing of aging processes would yield enormous social and economic benefits. For instance, a 2013 analysis suggested that *a modest delay in aging that increases healthy lifespan by 2.2 years could save $7 trillion in healthcare over 50 years* ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=Even%20a%20modest%20delay%20in,increase%20in%20unhealthy%20life%20span)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=%247,increase%20in%20unhealthy%20life%20span)). Barzilai uses such figures to advocate for investment in geroscience as a public health imperative. Rather than spending trillions treating each disease of aging separately, he argues, let’s **invest in targeting the root cause (aging)** and *“extend the period of healthy life”* for everyone ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=first%20proposed%20by%20a%20group,the%20period%20of%20healthy%20life)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=enormous%20benefits%20for%20quality%20of,the%20period%20of%20healthy%20life)). This paradigm shift could help societies handle the demographic wave of elderly populations with less chronic illness and dependency. Barzilai frequently collaborates with demographers and economists (like Olshansky) to push this message that **treating aging is the most cost-effective path** to extend healthy, happy lives at scale ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=The%20comorbidity%20strategy%20is%20key,Olshansky)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=not%20arguing%E2%80%94and%20we%27ve%20never%20argued%E2%80%94that,the%20period%20of%20healthy%20life)).

Ethically, Barzilai tends to downplay sci-fi notions of radically extended lifespans (he often distances himself from the likes of Aubrey de Grey’s talk of 1000-year lifespans ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=idea%20is%20that%20slowing%20down,the%20period%20of%20healthy%20life))). He focuses on achievable, incremental gains. *“We’re not arguing – and we’ve never argued – that we’re trying to achieve life extension… We’ll probably live a little longer if we succeed, but that’s not the goal,”* Olshansky says of the geroscience approach Barzilai champions. *“The goal is the extension of the period of healthy life.”* ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=idea%20is%20that%20slowing%20down,the%20period%20of%20healthy%20life)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=not%20arguing%E2%80%94and%20we%27ve%20never%20argued%E2%80%94that,the%20period%20of%20healthy%20life)). Barzilai shares this sentiment. He often notes that **aging is natural** – *“you’re born, you die, you age in between”* – and he isn’t seeking to “cure” aging to achieve immortality ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=chronic%20diseases%20whose%20incidence%20rises,if%20I%20can%20delay%20it)). Instead, he analogizes treating aging to **preventative maintenance**: we’re not making humans unaging; we’re just helping them function better for longer, delaying the “breakdowns.” In a sense, Barzilai sees aging itself as something like a risk factor or condition that can be managed. Whether or not one calls it a “disease” is semantics to him; *“I don’t care what they call it, if I can delay it,”* he says pragmatically ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=chronic%20diseases%20whose%20incidence%20rises,if%20I%20can%20delay%20it)).

On the topic of **happiness and quality of life**, Barzilai has a nuanced view shaped by his centenarian studies. He recognizes that longevity without quality is undesirable. A key measure of success in his trials is **healthspan**, not just lifespan. In personal conversations, Barzilai often highlights moments of joy and engagement in his 100-year-old participants – many still find happiness in small daily pleasures (a good bowl of soup, a game of bridge, time with family) ([What Do a Bunch of Old Jews Know About Living Forever?](https://www.yu.edu/news/what-do-a-bunch-of-old-jews-know-about-living-forever#:~:text=exceptional%20aging%20that%20centers%20on,Tommy%20runs)) ([What Do a Bunch of Old Jews Know About Living Forever?](https://www.yu.edu/news/what-do-a-bunch-of-old-jews-know-about-living-forever#:~:text=bad%20cold%2C%20Irving%20Kahn%20hasn%E2%80%99t,But%20even%20though)). This reinforces his belief that **life can be meaningful and worth living even in very old age**, provided health is reasonably maintained. It also suggests that interventions to extend life should strive to preserve *the capacity for enjoyment and purpose*. Barzilai supports research not only on physical health but also on cognitive aging, so that added years are mentally sharp and fulfilling. Notably, one angle of his work looks at why some centenarians remain *“sharp as a tack”* mentally (so-called **SuperAgers**) – presumably due to genetic and lifestyle factors that protect the brain ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=Superagers%20are%20those%2095%20and,abilities%20of%20much%20younger%20people)) ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThey%20enjoy%20extended%20health%2C%E2%80%9D%20explains,causing%20inherited%20mutations)). He is optimistic that **Alzheimer’s and dementia can be delayed** as part of targeting aging, citing data that centenarian genetic variants (like the cholesterol gene) also correlate with later onset of dementia ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=inherited%20mutations)). To Barzilai, success would mean more people reaching 100 while still doing the things that give them joy and meaning. In his words, *“Live to 100 and die totally happy,”* which was the tagline of a recent interview he gave ([The Future You: Interview With Dr. Nir Barzilai ](https://www.menshealth.com/health/a63655926/future-you-exceptional-longevity-dr-nir-barzilai/#:~:text=Live%20to%20100%20and%20Die,Totally%20Happy)).

## Public Health and Lifestyle Recommendations by Barzilai  
Dr. Barzilai is often asked: *What can people do **now** to maximize their chances of healthy longevity?* While much of his research centers on genetic and pharmaceutical interventions, he readily offers practical **lifestyle advice** – many of which he follows personally. His recommendations can be summarized as follows:

- **Stay Physically Active:** *“Go a little farther every day,”* Barzilai says ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=Step%20out)). He aims for **10,000 steps daily**, does weekly **strength training**, and practices balance exercises ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=Step%20out)). Regular exercise helps maintain muscle (preventing frailty), supports cardiovascular health, and even boosts mood and cognitive function. Barzilai stresses consistency – daily movement – over extreme athletic feats. Find activities you enjoy so that you’ll keep doing them for decades.

- **Maintain a Healthy Diet (and Don’t Overeat):** Barzilai advises **moderation in diet** with an eye towards maintaining a healthy weight and metabolism. He is enthusiastic about **intermittent fasting (16:8)**, which he practices, as a way to potentially slow aging processes ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=Eat%20less)). This means limiting food intake to an ~8-hour window each day and fasting for the other ~16 hours (for example, skipping breakfast or dinner). He also suggests generally **eating less** – avoid constant snacking or excess calories – as studies in animals and humans suggest metabolic benefits from mild caloric restriction. His diet is balanced during eating periods, including plenty of vegetables and proteins, but he doesn’t endorse any fad supplements for longevity (he’s skeptical of unproven pills). 

- **Get Sufficient Sleep:** Barzilai makes sure to **sleep ~7 hours per night**, and he encourages aiming for 7–8 hours if possible ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=Sleep%20more)). Adequate sleep is linked to better immune function, hormone balance, and cognitive health. He notes that sleep is when the brain and body perform critical repair processes. Chronic sleep deprivation, conversely, is associated with accelerated aging markers. Thus, prioritize a good sleep routine as part of your longevity plan.

- **Cultivate a Positive Mindset and Manage Stress:** One striking lesson from centenarians is the power of **outlook**. Barzilai observes that the long-lived tend to *“be very interested in being happy”* and let go of negativity easily ([Dr. Nir Barzilai—Genetics and Lifestyle Factors of Centenarians](https://blog.insidetracker.com/longevity-by-design-nir-barzilai#:~:text=He%20goes%20on%20to%20show,things%20to%20make%20them%20happy)). While personality is partly innate, Barzilai advises working on resilience – for instance, practicing gratitude, focusing on the good in life, and not dwelling on stressors excessively. Finding healthy ways to de-stress (through meditation, yoga, engaging in nature, etc.) can improve quality of life and possibly longevity. In Barzilai’s words, *“mindset is everything”* – a positive attitude might not make you live to 100 by itself, but it makes whatever years you have richer and may buffer the physiological effects of stress ([Dr. Nir Barzilai—Genetics and Lifestyle Factors of Centenarians](https://blog.insidetracker.com/longevity-by-design-nir-barzilai#:~:text=He%20goes%20on%20to%20show,things%20to%20make%20them%20happy)). Notably, research from his group found *lower levels of neuroticism and higher optimism* in centenarians as a group ([Longevity experts: People who live the longest share these 2 traits](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/03/longevity-experts-people-who-live-the-longest-share-these-2-traits.html#:~:text=Longevity%20experts%3A%20People%20who%20live,according%20to%20a%202012%20study)).

- **Stay Socially Connected:** Barzilai emphasizes **social and family connections** as a key to long-term well-being ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=Think%20holistically)). Loneliness can exacerbate aging, whereas relationships nourish us emotionally and even help keep us mentally sharp. He points out that many centenarians have close-knit families and communities. Therefore, invest in friendships, join community activities, and seek a support network as you age. Helping others and being involved can also give a sense of purpose.

- **Never Retire Your Purpose:** *“Finding purpose in life”* is something Barzilai highlights as a factor that *“helps keep people young longer.”* ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=Think%20holistically)) Whether it’s a profession, a hobby, volunteer work, or caring for grandchildren, having meaningful roles seems to motivate people to stay active and engaged. Barzilai himself continues to work tirelessly in his 60s; he often notes he has no plans to slow down because the mission drives him. For others, he suggests continually learning new things, setting goals, or nurturing passions at every age. Cognitive engagement and lifelong learning can stave off decline.

- **Use Preventive Healthcare:** Take advantage of modern medicine’s preventative tools. Barzilai specifically mentions getting the **annual flu shot** (and presumably other vaccines like COVID or pneumonia for elders) ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=Think%20holistically)). These simple measures reduce the risk of acute illnesses that can seriously affect older adults. Additionally, manage chronic conditions proactively: keep blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar under control (with medication if needed) to avoid cumulative damage. Regular screenings (colonoscopies, mammograms, etc. as appropriate) are also part of staying ahead of disease. In essence, *don’t ignore medical advice* – add years to your life by preventing or catching problems early.

- **Avoid Bad Habits:** Barzilai’s centenarian studies showed that some very old folks smoked or drank heavily in youth – but those were likely lucky exceptions. For most people, **smoking, heavy drinking, or leading a sedentary life will cut life short**. So, standard advice applies: don’t smoke (or quit if you do), moderate alcohol, and avoid risky behaviors. Barzilai quips that it’s better not to test your genetic luck in these areas, since few have the protective genes that some centenarians had to offset unhealthy habits ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThey%20enjoy%20extended%20health%2C%E2%80%9D%20explains,causing%20inherited%20mutations)).

In summary, Barzilai’s lifestyle advice is grounded in common-sense health promotion, reinforced by insights from longevity science. He doesn’t promise that doing these things will make you live to 100 – genetics and chance still play a role – but **they will improve your odds of a longer, disease-free life**, and importantly, a happier life. *“We can always maximize our health,”* Barzilai says. Even if you didn’t win the genetic lottery, following these practices can help you reap some of the benefits that “SuperAgers” enjoy ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=How%20to%20maximize%20your%20health,you%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20Superager%20genes)) ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20can%20always%20maximize%20our,extend%20his%20own%20life%20span)).

## Critiques and Debates Surrounding Barzilai’s Approach  
Dr. Barzilai’s work has earned widespread admiration, but it’s not without its skeptics and challenges. In the scientific community, most agree with his premise that **aging is modifiable**; the debates are more about *how* and *when* to intervene, and *for whom*. Here are a few points of discussion:

- **“Aging is Not a Disease” Debate:** Some gerontologists argue whether aging should be classified as a disease. Barzilai takes a middle road – he doesn’t insist on labeling aging as a disease (he calls it “humanity”), but for practical purposes he wants the medical field to target it ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=chronic%20diseases%20whose%20incidence%20rises,if%20I%20can%20delay%20it)). A few bioethicists worry that medicalizing aging could pathologize a natural process or raise false hopes of “cures.” Barzilai responds that the goal is not to *cure* aging but to treat its consequences. By framing TAME endpoints as multiple diseases, he sidestepped the semantic debate. The FDA’s openness to TAME suggests regulators are willing to consider aging as a legitimate therapeutic target, a stance Barzilai worked hard to foster ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=,details%2C%20yes)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=Sandy%20Walsh%2C%20an%20FDA%20spokeswoman%2C,the%20idea%20of%20a%20trial)).

- **Conservative Approach to Off-Label Interventions:** Barzilai’s stance on **metformin use in the young** has sparked discussion. His *horrified* reaction to healthy 30-somethings taking metformin for longevity  ([Metformin As Anti-Aging Drug: Side Effects, Risks, Scientific Advice - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/metformin-diabetes-weight-loss-anti-aging-drug-long-covid-prevention-2023-2#:~:text=Barzilai%20himself%20believes%20that%20for,effects%20on%20testosterone%20and%20muscle)) drew attention because some other longevity proponents (including a few tech “biohackers”) have been experimenting with metformin or supplements at younger ages. Barzilai’s position is backed by many experts: it’s premature and possibly harmful for young, healthy people to use a drug like metformin without medical need. *The drug’s potential side effects on exercise capacity, fertility (one study linked paternal metformin use to birth defects) ([Metformin As Anti-Aging Drug: Side Effects, Risks, Scientific Advice - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/metformin-diabetes-weight-loss-anti-aging-drug-long-covid-prevention-2023-2#:~:text=acid%20buildup%20in%20the%20bloodstream,the%20risk%20of%20birth%20defects)), and unknown long-term impact on those who already have low risk of age diseases make it inadvisable.* Some in the life-extension community have pushed back, arguing that metformin is safe enough that even if benefit is unproven, taking it is akin to an insurance policy. Barzilai counters that we should “prove or disprove” the benefit in trials first ([Metformin As Anti-Aging Drug: Side Effects, Risks, Scientific Advice - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/metformin-diabetes-weight-loss-anti-aging-drug-long-covid-prevention-2023-2#:~:text=,Quarta%20said)) – science should lead, not blind optimism. This debate highlights a **tension between biohackers vs. scientists**: Barzilai represents the cautious, evidence-based approach.

- **Rapamycin vs. Metformin:** A question often posed is whether Barzilai’s focus on metformin is **too cautious**, given that rapamycin has shown stronger lifespan extension in animals ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=compounds%20that%20might%20alter%20or,Sierra)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=His%20colleagues%20agreed%2C%20sometimes%20reluctantly,I%20thought%2C%20%27Strategically%2C%20he%27s%20right)). A number of longevity researchers (and pet owners, in the case of dogs in a trial) are excited about low-dose rapamycin as a more potent intervention. Barzilai’s reasoning for not choosing rapamycin for TAME was based on safety and optics (avoiding any trial deaths or serious adverse effects) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=the%20proposed%20trial)). Some critics might say this delayed testing a potentially more effective drug, but most acknowledge his strategic logic. Notably, now that the door is ajar thanks to TAME’s progress, other trials are indeed looking at rapalogues (rapamycin-like drugs) in aging. Barzilai has indicated that *if TAME is successful, a next step could be trials of combinations or stronger drugs*, perhaps even including rapamycin analogues, but one step at a time ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=Barzilai%20concedes%20that%20he%20and,pharma%20to%20enter%20the%20field)). Thus, while some might have preferred a bolder first trial, Barzilai’s plan is generally seen as the right pragmatic move.

- **Biomarkers and Measuring Aging:** A technical challenge in Barzilai’s work has been how to **measure biological aging** reliably. Since the trial can’t last for decades, TAME uses the composite disease endpoint as a proxy ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=elderly%20people%3B%20half%20would%20get,of%20the%20other%20factors%20combined)). Some gerontologists argue that more direct biomarkers of aging (like epigenetic clocks, proteomic or metabolomic signatures) should be incorporated to see if metformin actually *slows aging* at a biological level. Barzilai has been involved in research on multi-marker approaches – for example, he mentioned combining diverse biomarkers (DNA methylation patterns, blood markers, etc.) to get a read on biological age ([Nir Barzilai on X: "By contrast, our work has demonstrated that ...](https://twitter.com/NirBarzilaiMD/status/1895238422354358769#:~:text=Nir%20Barzilai%20on%20X%3A%20,biomarkers%E2%80%94from%20epigenetic%20signatures%20to)). In one tweet, he indicated *“our work has demonstrated that combining diverse biomarkers — from epigenetic signatures to [other factors] — can better measure aging.”* ([Nir Barzilai on X: "By contrast, our work has demonstrated that ...](https://twitter.com/NirBarzilaiMD/status/1895238422354358769#:~:text=Nir%20Barzilai%20on%20X%3A%20,biomarkers%E2%80%94from%20epigenetic%20signatures%20to)). This is an evolving area. Some critics say without an agreed biomarker, proving an “anti-aging” effect will be statistically tricky. Barzilai agrees it’s tricky, which is why the FDA endpoints are diseases. He’s simultaneously supporting efforts (like the AFAR **FAST Initiative** for biomarker discovery) to identify robust biological age measures that could be used in future trials.

- **Financial and Structural Hurdles:** The delay in starting TAME due to funding raised concerns and even skepticism in public forums. On Reddit and other platforms, some wondered *“why is it taking so long to even start?”* and whether there were scientific reservations ([Why is the TAME trial taking so long to even start? : r/longevity - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/longevity/comments/1cl7x60/why_is_the_tame_trial_taking_so_long_to_even_start/#:~:text=Why%20is%20the%20TAME%20trial,as%20far%20as%20trials%20go)). The truth was largely financial and bureaucratic, not scientific – something Barzilai has openly lamented. He has half-jokingly expressed frustration at the lack of urgency among funders given the high stakes. One could critique that perhaps the trial’s fundraising could have been structured differently (e.g. a large consortium of international funders). But Barzilai has tirelessly pitched the trial; it highlights that even great ideas can stall without alignment of incentives. This challenge isn’t so much a critique of Barzilai personally as it is of the system (no pharmaceutical profit means hard to fund). It underscores Barzilai’s point about needing new models to finance **preventative geriatric interventions** that benefit society at large.

- **Public Perception and Hype:** Some bioethicists have cautioned against over-promising the effects of an “aging pill.” There’s a concern that public hype could outpace evidence, leading to disillusionment or misuse. Barzilai is aware of this, which is why he’s careful in messaging. He emphasizes healthspan, not radical life extension, and often provides context that metformin is *“not magic”* but could modestly delay some diseases ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=adult%20type%202%20diabetics%20in,matched%20controls)). In talks, he uses phrases like *“not just a hope but a promise”* ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=Advertisement)), which are optimistic but measured. Nonetheless, managing expectations is an ongoing task. When headlines tout “anti-aging drug,” Barzilai and colleagues try to clarify that we are talking about delaying aging, not stopping it. His measured, data-driven communication is generally well-regarded, but the field as a whole faces skepticism from those who recall past anti-aging fads. By engaging with media, writing a book for lay readers, and even appearing on podcasts, Barzilai attempts to **educate the public** and draw a clear line between evidence-based geroscience and quackery. As a result, even critics acknowledge that Barzilai provides a *responsible* voice in a domain prone to charlatans.

In summary, the critiques around Barzilai’s work tend to revolve around pace and priorities (which intervention first? how to fund it? how to measure it?), rather than opposition to the core concept. The scientific community largely supports his central thesis that aging can be targeted to prevent disease ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=The%20group%27s%20paranoia%20about%20the,the%20nonprofit%20AFAR%2C%20not%20a)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=The%20comorbidity%20strategy%20is%20key,Olshansky)). If anything, the “debate” is now about optimizing this new paradigm. Barzilai welcomes healthy debate – he often collaborates with other thought leaders (many of whom were initially skeptical but came on board). His leadership in convening consensus, such as aligning multiple research centers for TAME, shows his skill in coalition-building. And as results emerge (for example, if metformin in TAME shows even a 1-2 year delay in major diseases), it’s likely any remaining skeptics will be won over. Barzilai’s work, once considered fringe, is rapidly becoming mainstream geriatric medicine.

## Conclusion and Future Outlook  
Dr. Nir Barzilai stands at the forefront of a revolution in aging science. His research on centenarian genetics revealed that *nature’s longevity secrets can be decoded* – and perhaps recreated – to help the broader population. By identifying gene variants that protect against diseases of old age, he paved the way for **gerotherapeutics** (drugs that mimic those genetic effects). His championing of metformin as a test case has already altered how researchers and regulators think about aging; thanks to Barzilai and colleagues, the FDA is **entertaining the idea of “aging” as a treatable condition** for the first time ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=,details%2C%20yes)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=Sandy%20Walsh%2C%20an%20FDA%20spokeswoman%2C,the%20idea%20of%20a%20trial)). The upcoming TAME trial will be a pivotal experiment. If it succeeds, it will validate decades of animal research in humans – showing that an existing medicine can modestly slow the onset of age-related disorders. That would open the floodgates for new, more powerful interventions (from senolytic drugs that clear senescent cells to gene therapies) to be tested in humans with regulatory support. Barzilai predicts that in the future, *“the FDA will develop an easier indication to define aging in clinical research,”* which will streamline such studies ([Dawn of a new indication: How to study drugs for aging](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/features/dawn-of-a-new-indication-how-to-study-drugs-for-aging/#:~:text=Dawn%20of%20a%20new%20indication%3A,this%20may%20give%20studies)). In essence, he is pushing the **translational frontier**: moving longevity research from the lab to the clinic.

On the horizon, Barzilai is involved in or inspiring numerous projects. For example, he is helping lead a **SuperAgers Family Study** in collaboration with Boston University, aiming to enroll people 95+ (and their kids) to further dissect what keeps them so healthy ([How to Live a Better, Longer Life: The Secrets of Superagers](https://www.prevention.com/health/a60237608/live-longer-secrets-of-superagers/#:~:text=Calling%20all%20Superagers%21)). He’s also engaged in the AFAR **SuperAgers Initiative** and the **FAST Initiative** (Fiat Accelerated Senescence Therapy, presumably) to accelerate biomarker discovery and drug testing ([Ask the Expert Interviews - American Federation for Aging Research](https://www.afar.org/ask-the-expert-interviews#:~:text=Driving%20Innovation%20by%20guiding%20studies,37%2C%20and%20the%20TAME%20Trial)). Beyond metformin, Barzilai keeps a close eye on compounds like acarbose, NAD+ precursors, anti-inflammatories, and others that showed promise in animal studies ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=The%20next%20question%20was%3A%20What,the%20best%20drug%20to%20test)) ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=compounds%20that%20might%20alter%20or,Sierra)). In the private sector, as an advisor or co-founder, he contributes to ventures exploring mitochondrial peptides (through CohBar) and other innovative therapeutics to **extend healthspan** ([Nir Barzilai - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nir_Barzilai#:~:text=their%20genetic%20homogeneity%2C%20which%20makes,treat%20diseases%20associated%20with%20aging)). 

Importantly, Barzilai is shaping the narrative around aging. Through his public outreach – whether on podcasts, social media, or policy forums – he consistently emphasizes that the *aim is not to let people languish in nursing homes for extra years, but to reduce the time they spend sick and increase the time they spend well*. He often cites that centenarians in his study not only lived long but stayed *independent and productive much longer than average*, compressing illness into a brief period at life’s end ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=live%20life%20to%20the%20fullest)) ([What We Can Learn About Longevity From SuperAgers and Centenarians | Next Avenue](https://www.nextavenue.org/what-we-can-learn-about-longevity-from-superagers-and-centenarians/#:~:text=In%20my%20studies%2C%20not%20only,as%20medical%20costs%20are%20saved)). This *“compression of morbidity”* is exactly what he wants for everyone. And notably, many centenarians in his studies remained in good humor and mentally sharp; Barzilai wants to democratize that outcome.

As longevity science progresses, Barzilai also engages with **philosophical questions**: How will society adjust if more people live to 100 in good health? How do we ensure those extra years are meaningful and supported? He participates in discussions on the ethics of longevity — for instance, speaking at the Vatican’s 2022 longevity summit (as seen on his Twitter) ([Nir Barzilai ✓](https://twitter.com/NirBarzilaiMD?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor#:~:text=Nir%20Barzilai%20%E2%9C%93%20We%20are,very%20first%20Vatican%20Longevity%20Summit)), and at policy think-tanks like the Milken Institute ([Why Some People Have Longevity Genes and Others Don't](https://milkeninstitute.org/content-hub/collections/articles/why-some-people-have-longevity-genes-and-others-dont-conversation-longevity-innovator-dr-nir#:~:text=Why%20Some%20People%20Have%20Longevity,related%20diseases)). His perspective is generally reassuring: history has shown life expectancy gains (like eliminating childhood disease or improving cardiac care) gave net benefits to society. He believes the same will hold true for aging interventions, especially if we focus on healthspan. He envisions a world where people might routinely take a suite of **anti-aging therapies in mid-life** – perhaps a pill (like metformin or a future drug) combined with personalized lifestyle programs – to prevent chronic diseases before they start. In Barzilai’s words, this would be *“the ultimate in preventive medicine”* ([Cheap longevity drug? Researchers aim to test if metformin can slow down aging : Shots - Health News : NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/22/1245872510/a-cheap-drug-may-slow-down-aging-a-study-will-determine-if-it-works#:~:text=Sponsor%20Message)) ([Cheap longevity drug?

Dr. Nir Barzilai’s contributions span hardcore molecular research to big-picture public health strategy. Few scientists manage to work at both levels. As a result, he has become a key spokesman for the geroscience field. His blend of scientific rigor, personal charisma (often described as ebullient and humorous ([The man who wants to beat back aging  | Science | AAAS](https://www.science.org/content/article/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging#:~:text=Barzilai%20is%20a%20former%20Israeli,aging.%22%20His%20colleagues%20pounced))), and heartfelt conviction make him an effective advocate for viewing aging in a new light – *as a modifiable risk factor, something we can tackle to allow more people to “die young as late as possible.”*  Thanks to his work, the once-radical idea of **slowing human aging** is now taken seriously by mainstream medicine. And if Barzilai’s vision comes to fruition, the coming decades will see aging deliberately targeted in clinical practice, resulting in more of us living not just longer, but **better**, well into our 90s and beyond – with a sparkle in our eyes and a purpose in our hearts, much like the centenarians who inspired him.
