# Health and Longevity Advice from Dr. Judith Campisi

Judith Campisi, Ph.D., is a world-renowned biogerontologist and pioneer in aging research, best known for her work on **cellular senescence** – the process by which cells irreversibly stop dividing and secrete inflammatory factors as they age. Over decades of research, Campisi has translated her deep scientific insights into practical guidance on how to live a longer and healthier life. This report compiles all of her explicit health and longevity recommendations from publicly available sources – including academic papers, interviews, articles, lectures, and podcasts – and presents them in an accessible way. Campisi’s advice centers on interventions that target the fundamental aging processes (especially chronic inflammation driven by senescent cells) to **extend healthspan**, the years of life spent in good health.

**In summary, Dr. Campisi’s longevity recommendations cover:**

1. **Diet and Nutrition:** Eating a balanced diet and avoiding chronic overeating; leveraging periodic **fasting** to clear out damaged cells.  
2. **Exercise:** Engaging in regular physical activity, which she calls “probably the single most important intervention” for health.  
3. **Sleep:** Prioritizing adequate sleep and circadian health, since even short-term sleep loss can accelerate aging processes.  
4. **Stress Management:** Embracing manageable intellectual and hormetic stress (like mental challenges or exercise) while avoiding chronic, severe stress; staying passionate and engaged in life.  
5. **Supplements and Nutraceuticals:** Considering natural compounds like certain **flavonoids** (e.g. quercetin, fisetin, apigenin) and **NAD⁺ boosters** that may mitigate aging processes, though with cautious expectations.  
6. **Senolytics and Drugs:** Supporting the development of **senolytic drugs** (which remove senescent cells) and other pharmacological interventions like **rapamycin** and **metformin** that target aging pathways – but also acknowledging their current experimental status and potential risks.  
7. **Biomarkers and Monitoring:** Tracking and reducing chronic **inflammation** (“inflammaging”) and other biomarkers of aging, and using emerging tools to measure senescent cell burden.  
8. **Future Therapies:** Looking ahead to novel therapies (senolytics, gene therapy, immune-based approaches) to further extend healthy lifespan – while maintaining realistic expectations grounded in data.

Each section below explores these recommendations in detail, highlighting Campisi’s own words and explanations for why these interventions can promote longevity. All source material from Dr. Campisi’s public statements is cited with inline hyperlinks for verification. The goal is to present her advice clearly and accurately, without extraneous biography or theory not directly tied to practical health guidance.

## The Role of Cellular Senescence in Aging (Why Campisi Focuses on It)

To understand Campisi’s recommendations, it helps to know **why** she emphasizes certain strategies. Her research revealed that as we age, we accumulate senescent cells that no longer divide but remain metabolically active – secreting inflammatory and tissue-degrading molecules (a mix of cytokines, proteases, and growth factors known as the **senescence-associated secretory phenotype** or **SASP**). This chronic secretion creates a toxic microenvironment in tissues, driving **“inflammaging”** – a state of persistent low-grade inflammation that contributes to many diseases of aging ([

In fact, Campisi found that senescent cells are a major **“driver” of aging**, implicated in everything from arthritis and atherosclerosis to neurodegeneration and cancer ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity.

Importantly, senescence is a double-edged sword: it’s a mechanism to prevent cancer (by halting division of damaged cells) but at the cost of later fostering chronic inflammation and tissue damage ([Ask the Experts: Can Aging Be Controlled? | Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/aging-ask-the-experts-can-aging-be-controlled/#:~:text=A%20few%20years%20ago%2C%20we,you%20die%20later%20and%20miserably)) ([Interviews on Aspects of Aging with Judith Campisi and Dena Dubal – Fight Aging!](https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2022/08/interviews-on-aspects-of-aging-with-judith-campisi-and-dena-dubal/#:~:text=discuss%20quite%20different%20aspects%20of,and%20destruction%20is%20disrupted%20with)). Dr. Campisi often refers to this as an evolutionary **trade-off** – beneficial early in life, deleterious later ([Ask the Experts: Can Aging Be Controlled? | Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/aging-ask-the-experts-can-aging-be-controlled/#:~:text=persist,you%20die%20later%20and%20miserably)). Her goal is to **preserve the benefits** of senescence (cancer suppression) while **mitigating the harms** (inflammation and degeneration). 

> “If you don’t have the senescence mechanism, you die early of cancer. But if you do have this mechanism, you die later **and miserably**.” – *Judith Campisi, Scientific American interview* ([Ask the Experts: Can Aging Be Controlled? | Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/aging-ask-the-experts-can-aging-be-controlled/#:~:text=A%20few%20years%20ago%2C%20we,you%20die%20later%20and%20miserably))

Because multiple cellular processes contribute to aging (DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, senescence, etc.), Campisi argues there won’t be a single magic bullet to radically extend lifespan ([Ask the Experts: Can Aging Be Controlled? | Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/aging-ask-the-experts-can-aging-be-controlled/#:~:text=How%20many%20different%20causes%20of,be%20crazy%20to%20believe%20me)). Instead, a combination of approaches is needed to tackle aging’s various “hallmarks.” As she put it, believing we will suddenly extend human life to 500+ years with one breakthrough is “like a religion, not science... it’s based on faith, not on data” ([«Creer que alargaremos la vida 500 años se basa en la fe, no en datos» - MIT Technology Review en español](https://technologyreview.es/article/creer-que-alargaremos-la-vida-500-anos-se-basa-en-la-fe-no-en-datos/#:~:text=vida%20humana%20hasta%20los%20500,000%20a%C3%B1os)). Rather, her focus is on **evidence-based interventions** that can modestly slow aging or improve **healthspan**. Many of these interventions aim to reduce the burden or impact of senescent cells and inflammation in the body.

With that context, the following sections describe Campisi’s explicit advice on lifestyle, diet, and therapies to promote healthy longevity. Each recommendation is rooted in how it influences fundamental aging processes (especially senescence and inflammaging). Campisi’s tone is often cautious – she emphasizes what **science supports now** for staying healthy longer, while remaining skeptical of unproven “anti-aging” fads. 

## Healthy Diet and Caloric Intake

### Emphasize a Balanced Diet (and Don’t Overeat)

Dr. Campisi consistently advises sticking to a **healthy, balanced diet** as a foundation for longevity. While she doesn’t prescribe a specific diet (e.g. Mediterranean, keto, etc.) by name, her guidance implies eating nutritious whole foods that support metabolic health and minimize inflammation. In interviews, she notes that many so-called anti-aging pills have little effect compared to basic good nutrition. For example, when discussing how to live longer, she often suggests that the answers aren’t exotic: “You know the answer” – meaning the common-sense habits of eating right and exercising are still crucial ([Expert Tip - Dr Judith Campisi - You Know the Answer - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx3baRZAoDQ#:~:text=YouTube%20www,distributed%20each%20week%20and)).

One key aspect of diet that Campisi highlights is **avoiding chronic overeating**. Excess calories (especially from unhealthy foods) can drive metabolic problems and inflammation that accelerate aging. Overnutrition can lead to obesity, insulin resistance, and more senescent cells accumulating in tissues ([Lifestyle interventions to delay senescence - ScienceDirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2319417023001130#:~:text=ScienceDirect.com%20www.sciencedirect.com%20%20A%20high,senescence%3A%20when%20bad%20things)). By contrast, maintaining a **healthy body weight** through balanced eating is likely to reduce the production of senescent cells. In her research, Campisi has seen that a high-fat or high-calorie diet can induce senescence in organs (for instance, a fatty diet caused senescent cell buildup in the pancreas of mice) ([Lifestyle interventions to delay senescence - ScienceDirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2319417023001130#:~:text=Lifestyle%20interventions%20to%20delay%20senescence,senescence%3A%20when%20bad%20things)). Thus, while she doesn’t dictate macronutrient ratios, she endorses **moderation and quality** of food intake.

In practical terms, Campisi suggests eating plenty of natural plant-based foods that contain bioactive compounds. Interestingly, some of the very compounds she studies for their senolytic or anti-inflammatory effects are **dietary-derived**. For example, **quercetin** (a flavonoid found in apples, onions, and berries) and **fisetin** (found in strawberries and persimmons) are phytochemicals one can get through diet or supplements, and these have been shown to influence senescent cells. Campisi notes that such flavonoids can help tamp down the SASP (the inflammatory secretions of senescent cells) ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=enhances%20the%20senescence,job%20at%20reducing%20senescent%20cells)). While their effects aren’t strong enough to single-handedly stop aging, she “undoubtedly” believes they **“will help”** as part of a healthy diet ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=Judith%20Campisi%20,really%20beneficial%20longterm%20for%20multiple)). In one podcast, she mentioned quercetin, fisetin and apigenin (another plant-derived compound from chamomile and parsley) as natural substances that **suppress parts of the SASP** – meaning they can reduce some inflammatory signals from senescent cells ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=Judith%20Campisi%20,two%20specific%20indicators%20of%20health)). Including foods rich in these polyphenols or taking them as supplements might contribute to a lower inflammatory state in the body.

Beyond specific nutrients, Campisi also stresses **not to fall for miracle foods or extreme diets** as the sole solution. The basic pattern of **wholesome eating** – fruits, vegetables, adequate protein, healthy fats – combined with maintaining a moderate calorie intake, is what she practices herself. She admits she’s “too busy” to micromanage her own diet beyond sensible eating ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=Judith%20Campisi%2C%20who%20is%20in,may%20be%20leading%20to%20disease)), indicating that she relies on general healthy habits rather than elaborate biohacking diets. 

In fact, Campisi has a bit of a lighthearted approach to her personal diet: she jokes that one of her main anti-aging secrets is **drinking good wine**. “Only slightly tongue-in-cheek,” she says the main steps she takes to stay energetic are “**drinking wine and worrying**.” She loves a glass of fine red wine whenever she can, noting that **moderate wine drinking has been associated with longevity**, and that having passions (such as an enjoyment of wine and winemaking) is healthy ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=She%20last%20took%20a%20vacation,passions%20is%20healthy%2C%20she%20says)). This reflects the data on Mediterranean diets – moderate red wine intake (rich in polyphenols like resveratrol) correlates with heart health and longevity, and social pleasures like wine may reduce stress. Campisi emphasizes *moderation* here; we’re talking about an occasional glass, not heavy drinking. The key point she makes is that one shouldn’t live an ascetic life devoid of enjoyment in the name of longevity. **Finding joy and pleasure in food (and drink) in a balanced way** is part of a healthy life. “I just love wine,” she says – and as long as it’s moderate, that fits within a longevity lifestyle ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=She%20last%20took%20a%20vacation,passions%20is%20healthy%2C%20she%20says)).

To summarize Campisi’s dietary advice: **eat a nutritious, balanced diet, and don’t consistently overeat.** There’s no magic superfood, but diets high in natural plant compounds (fruits, veggies, spices) could help lower inflammation. Enjoy life’s pleasures like a good glass of wine in moderation. These commonsense habits create a metabolic environment where fewer cells become senescent and inflammatory. And they set the stage for the more targeted strategy Campisi strongly advocates in diet: **intermittent fasting**, described next.

### Intermittent Fasting and “Housekeeping” for Cells

If there is one dietary intervention Dr. Campisi highlights most for longevity, it is **fasting** – specifically, intermittent or periodic fasting. Fasting, in her view, triggers a beneficial cleansing process that the body already evolved, effectively a natural mechanism to **clear out senescent cells**. She refers to fasting as a kind of biological “housekeeping” for the body ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=interest%20to%20the%20field%20of,which%20can%20promote%20cellular%20senescence)). When you abstain from food for a sufficient period, your body gets rid of damaged cells (through processes like autophagy and apoptosis) and can even eliminate some fraction of senescent cells that are lingering. Once the fast is broken and nutrients become available, the body can then regenerate with fresh cells (for example, activating stem cells to produce new immune or tissue cells).

Campisi often cites research by her colleague Dr. Valter Longo and others on fasting’s effects. In mice, **prolonged fasting** (48+ hours for a mouse, equivalent to perhaps 4-5 days in humans) caused a dramatic clearance of damaged cells – “presumably senescent cells” – followed by a “massive and robust increase in stem cell proliferation” to renew the tissues ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=match%20at%20L882%20prolonged%20fasting,increase%20in%20stem%20cell%20proliferation)). In other words, a cycle of fasting purges the old cells and then the body rebounds by generating new healthy cells, effectively rejuvenating the tissue. Even shorter-term fasting can have powerful effects: Campisi notes that intermittent fasting or fasting-mimicking diets can improve metabolic factors and reduce inflammation. For example, periodic fasting has been shown to **enhance immune function** in ways that might clear senescent cells or at least mitigate their inflammatory impact ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=the%20adaptive%20immune%20system%20declines,some%20of%20the%20stem%20cells)). 

In one interview, Campisi agreed that doing an **“extended fast” at intervals** is conceptually similar to taking a senolytic drug – both aim to **periodically purge senescent cells** from the body ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=Dan%20Pardi%20,fast%2C%20perhaps%2C%20at%20some%20interval)). She prefers intermittent fasting to continuous calorie restriction, humorously noting that **“chronic fasting...of course, is no fun at all”** ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=fasting,fast%2C%20perhaps%2C%20at%20some%20interval)). Intermittent fasting (such as skipping meals on certain days or doing a 24-hour fast once or twice a week) is far more practical and sustainable. “That’s right,” Campisi said, **intermittent** as opposed to permanent fasting achieves the goal without misery ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=fasting,fast%2C%20perhaps%2C%20at%20some%20interval)). 

The fasting regimen can vary – some people do daily time-restricted feeding (e.g. eating only in an 8-hour window each day), others do a 5:2 plan (fasting 2 days per week), and others an occasional multi-day fast. Campisi has particularly pointed to **periodic prolonged fasts** (multi-day, but done occasionally) as an effective strategy, because these longer fasts more thoroughly trigger the “cleanup” programs in the body ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=Periodic%20prolonged%20fasts%20mimic%20some,these%20effects%20associated%20with%20rapamycin)). A prolonged fast causes insulin and growth-factor signaling to plummet and puts cells in a stress-resistant mode, prompting old or damaged cells to die off. She mentioned that **fasting tends to dampen the mTOR pathway** (more on mTOR in a later section) which in turn **reduces the SASP** – the inflammatory secretions of senescent cells ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=drug%20rapamycin%2C%20which%20is%20known,could%20be%20that%20fasting%2C%20and)). In essence, fasting flips a switch in cellular metabolism that not only might kill some senescent cells outright, but also make the remaining senescent cells quieter (less pro-inflammatory) by suppressing mTOR-driven secretion ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=drug%20rapamycin%2C%20which%20is%20known,could%20be%20that%20fasting%2C%20and)). This biochemical insight ties fasting to the same longevity pathway targeted by the drug rapamycin (which Campisi notes **also** works by inhibiting mTOR – we will revisit this connection later) ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=match%20at%20L921%20rapamycin%2C%20and,Valter%20is%20a%20proponent%20of)).

Practically speaking, what does Campisi recommend? While she hasn’t published a “fasting schedule” for the public, her interviews suggest she is supportive of **intermittent fasting routines** that fit one’s lifestyle. For instance, a common approach consistent with her advice would be doing a 16:8 time-restricted feeding (16 hours fasting, 8 hours eating) daily, or doing a 24-hour water fast once per week. In a podcast conversation, the host proposed the idea of occasionally doing a fast to clear senescent cells, and Campisi enthusiastically agreed with the concept ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=Dan%20Pardi%20,also%2C%20flavonols%2C%20things%20like%20quercitin)). The idea is to do it **“every so often”** – giving the body a periodic deep cleanse, rather than fasting constantly which is neither enjoyable nor necessary. 

Campisi also highlighted research where even **short-term fasting in humans** yielded benefits. One study she cited found that a brief fast before chemotherapy made the treatment more effective and reduced side effects in cancer patients ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=match%20at%20L902%20intermittent%20short,that%20damage%20DNA%2C%20definitely%20causes)). Her own lab’s mouse studies similarly showed that fasting prior to chemotherapy reduced the senescence and damage caused by the chemo ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=intermittent%20short,that%20damage%20DNA%2C%20definitely%20causes)). This is a striking example: even **temporary fasting can protect cells from stress** and eliminate problem cells, thereby improving health outcomes. So, for healthy individuals, intermittent fasting could likewise serve as a protective, regenerative habit.

It’s worth noting that Campisi differentiates **intermittent fasting** from chronic malnutrition. She is not advocating under-nutrition or deficiencies; rather, she suggests cycling between feeding and fasting states to harness the body’s natural maintenance programs. She also acknowledges fasting is a form of **hormetic stress** – a mild biological stress that makes the body stronger. Like exercise, fasting is a controlled stress that triggers adaptation. By regularly engaging in hormetic stresses (fasting, exercise, cold exposure, etc.), you improve the body’s ability to handle bigger challenges. Exercise and fasting are two prime hormetic stresses she often groups together as keys to longevity ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=include%20periodic%20fasting%2C%20which%20serves,which%20can%20promote%20cellular%20senescence)).

In summary, **Campisi explicitly recommends intermittent fasting** as a longevity strategy. Fasting can “rid the body of senescent cells from time to time” ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=interest%20to%20the%20field%20of,which%20can%20promote%20cellular%20senescence)), essentially taking out the cellular trash. This results in improved tissue function and a reset of the system. Whether it’s skipping meals occasionally or doing a fasting-mimicking diet periodically, giving your body those fasting periods is, according to Campisi, one of the most promising **lifestyle interventions to extend healthspan** ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=In%20this%20episode%2C%20Dr,drugs%20that%20kill%20senescent%20cells)). She even suggests that short-term fasting might confer many of the same benefits as certain anti-aging drugs but with fewer side effects ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=more%20benefit%20than%20taking%20a,rapamycin%20which%20has%20side%20effects)) – and you get the additional benefit of actually clearing out bad cells, not just suppressing them ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=Rhonda%3A%20Right%20because%20you%27re%20not,don%27t%20know%20how%20much%20of)). 

> **Key dietary advice from Campisi:** Maintain a healthy diet with plenty of plant foods (for their beneficial compounds) and avoid overeating. Incorporate **intermittent fasting** or periodic caloric restriction into your routine, as this can serve a “housecleaning” role to eliminate senescent cells and refresh your body’s cells ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=interest%20to%20the%20field%20of,which%20can%20promote%20cellular%20senescence)). This, in turn, lowers chronic inflammation and may delay age-related diseases.

## Regular Exercise and Physical Activity

If diet and fasting are one pillar of Campisi’s advice, **exercise** is another equally (if not more) important pillar. Dr. Campisi cannot emphasize enough how crucial regular physical activity is for long-term health. In fact, she has flat-out stated: **“Exercise is probably the single most important intervention that cuts across multiple diseases.”** ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=,Click%20To%20Tweet)) This quote encapsulates her view that exercise has universal benefits – it lowers the risk of almost every chronic condition, whether it’s heart disease, diabetes, neurodegeneration, or even cancer. Because aging is the biggest risk factor for those diseases, exercise essentially attacks aging at its roots, slowing down the emergence of pathology across the board.

Campisi’s strong endorsement of exercise comes from both scientific evidence and her understanding of aging biology. From a scientific perspective, countless studies show that regular exercise improves lifespan and, more importantly, **healthspan** – the proportion of life spent in good health. Physically active people tend to have lower biomarkers of inflammation, better metabolic health, stronger immune function, and less senescence in tissues compared to sedentary individuals. For example, exercise has been shown to reduce the accumulation of senescent cells in adipose (fat) tissue even when animals are fed a high-fat diet, mitigating what would otherwise be a pro-aging effect ([Exercise Prevents Diet-Induced Cellular Senescence in Adipose ...](https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/65/6/1606/35135/Exercise-Prevents-Diet-Induced-Cellular-Senescence#:~:text=Exercise%20Prevents%20Diet,cells%2C%20tumor%20suppression%2C%20and)). In humans, older adults who exercise have muscle and blood profiles that look “younger” at the cellular level – partly due to lower inflammation and possibly enhanced removal of senescent cells via improved circulation and immune surveillance.

Mechanistically, Campisi often points out that exercise works as a form of **hormetic stress** (much like fasting). When you exercise, you impose a low-level stress on the body – your muscles experience strain, your energy metabolism ramps up, and you produce reactive molecules. The body responds by increasing its resilience: muscles grow stronger, antioxidant defenses increase, and repair mechanisms activate. This **“primes your body to respond more effectively to larger stressors”** in the future ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=include%20periodic%20fasting%2C%20which%20serves,which%20can%20promote%20cellular%20senescence)). In other words, by regularly subjecting yourself to the controlled stress of exercise, you make your cells and organs better able to handle the uncontrolled stresses of aging (like oxidative damage, glucose spikes, etc.). Campisi particularly notes that exercise helps tune up the **mitochondria** – the powerhouses of the cell – whose dysfunction can promote cellular senescence if not kept in check ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=include%20periodic%20fasting%2C%20which%20serves,which%20can%20promote%20cellular%20senescence)). Healthy mitochondria mean less cellular damage and less tendency for cells to become senescent or die.

Another benefit of exercise that aligns with Campisi’s focus is that it **reduces chronic inflammation**. Exercise triggers the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines from muscles (sometimes called “myokines”) and leads to long-term reductions in inflammatory markers like CRP and IL-6. Campisi identifies chronic inflammation as a major contributor to aging (“inflammaging”), so anything that lowers inflammation systemically will slow the aging process. Exercise does this perhaps better than any medication: it engages the whole body in an anti-inflammatory, restorative process. It also supports the immune system in doing its job of clearing away damaged cells. Some researchers speculate (and Campisi herself has considered) that exercise may enhance the activity of immune cells that remove senescent cells (like NK cells and macrophages). So indirectly, working out could help **clean up senescent cells** more efficiently, though this is an active area of research.

From a practical standpoint, Campisi doesn’t prescribe a specific exercise regimen – the key is to **be active regularly** in whatever ways one can. Aerobic exercise (cardio) and resistance training (strength) both have immense benefits. In her interviews with popular media, when asked what people should do while science works on anti-aging therapies, her answer is consistently: **keep exercising** ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=W%20e%20all%20know%20what,aging%20research%20what%20they%20take)). It’s the one intervention available *today* that we know extends healthy years. Even as exciting new drugs are being researched, Campisi stresses that “in the meantime, keep exercising” because no pill can yet replicate the multi-system benefits of physical activity ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=There%E2%80%99s%20no%20consensus,In%20the%20meantime%2C%20keep%20exercising)).

Campisi herself, by her own admission, is very busy and doesn’t dwell constantly on her personal aging – but she acknowledges staying active is vital. (She’s mentioned ironically that Aubrey de Grey’s only personal longevity practice is not getting enough sleep due to work, whereas hers might be not taking vacations because she’s always active in the lab ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=Judith%20Campisi%2C%20who%20is%20in,may%20be%20leading%20to%20disease)) ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=She%20last%20took%20a%20vacation,passions%20is%20healthy%2C%20she%20says)). Nonetheless, being on her feet running experiments and traveling for talks likely gave her plenty of inadvertent exercise!). 

In an interview summary on FoundMyFitness, her viewpoint is highlighted succinctly: **exercise is the number one intervention** for healthspan ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=,Click%20To%20Tweet)). It “cuts across” diseases, meaning it doesn’t target just one condition – it simultaneously lowers risk for almost all age-related diseases. This broad-spectrum effect is what makes exercise so special in aging: it appears to slow the **rate of aging** itself, not just specific diseases. Exercise capacity (like one’s VO₂ max or strength) is a strong predictor of mortality risk – higher fitness correlates with lower biological age.

Campisi has also indicated that **exercise and diet work hand in hand**. For example, exercise can offset some negative effects of a poor diet. She cited a study where exercising mice showed fewer senescent cells even on a high-fat diet, suggesting that physical activity can counteract dietary stress to a degree ([Exercise Prevents Diet-Induced Cellular Senescence in Adipose ...](https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/65/6/1606/35135/Exercise-Prevents-Diet-Induced-Cellular-Senescence#:~:text=Exercise%20Prevents%20Diet,cells%2C%20tumor%20suppression%2C%20and)). Of course, the ideal is to combine good nutrition with exercise for synergistic benefits (which essentially recapitulates the often-heard advice: eat well and move your body). 

It’s important to include different forms of exercise: **endurance** training for cardiovascular health and **resistance** training for muscle and bone health. Both forms help improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammatory adipose tissue. Campisi hasn’t explicitly broken down how much of each to do, but geroscience experts often recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week plus muscle-strengthening activities twice a week. Given Campisi’s remark that exercise is so impactful, one could interpret that as encouraging daily physical activity – even if just walking on days between more intense workouts.

In conclusion, Dr. Campisi’s advice on exercise can be summed up as: **make exercise a non-negotiable part of your lifestyle**. It is arguably the most powerful tool we currently have to extend healthspan. By acting as a hormetic stress, exercise bolsters our cells’ defenses, keeps mitochondria efficient, reduces chronic inflammation, and helps prevent the accumulation of senescent cells ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=include%20periodic%20fasting%2C%20which%20serves,which%20can%20promote%20cellular%20senescence)). Over time, this translates into a slower aging process. No matter what new longevity molecules are discovered, Campisi believes they will do “very little good” if basic healthy behaviors like exercise are ignored ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=Aubrey%20de%20Grey%20insists%20that,His%20devotion%20to)). So, she urges everyone to stay physically active for as long as possible – it will pay dividends in extra years of high-quality life.

**Campisi’s exercise recommendation in her own words:** *“Exercise is probably the single most important intervention that cuts across multiple diseases.”* ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=,Click%20To%20Tweet)) In practice, that means regular workouts (endurance and strength), staying mobile, and generally avoiding a sedentary routine. This will keep your body biologically younger and extend your healthy years.

## Sleep, Recovery, and Stress Management

Longevity isn’t just about diet and exercise – **rest and stress management** are also crucial. Dr. Campisi recognizes the importance of good sleep and a balanced approach to stress. In her research and discussions, she highlights how **sleep deprivation and chronic stress can accelerate aging**, largely by increasing inflammation and cellular damage. Conversely, adequate sleep and positive forms of stress (like intellectual challenges) can improve healthspan.

### The Importance of Adequate Sleep

While Campisi’s work often centers on cellular and molecular factors, she has pointed out that something as everyday as **sleep** has a direct impact on aging processes. For instance, she cites a study by Dr. Judith Carroll at UCLA which showed that even a single night of **sleep deprivation** can **enhance the SASP** – the pro-inflammatory secretory profile of senescent cells ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=inflammatory%20molecules%20that%20are%20being,job%20at%20reducing%20senescent%20cells)). Essentially, when you don’t get enough sleep, your cells experience it as a stress, and senescent cells in particular respond by pumping out more inflammatory molecules. Campisi said this finding “makes sense” to her because severe sleep loss is a significant physiological stressor, and many stressors (radiation, toxins, etc.) drive cells into senescence or make existing senescent cells more active ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=lifestyle%20approach%2C%20because%20exercise%2C%20getting,job%20at%20reducing%20senescent%20cells)).

From this, Campisi draws a clear recommendation: **avoid chronic sleep deprivation** and strive for regular, sufficient sleep. If one night of poor sleep can measurably worsen inflammatory markers, imagine what habitual insufficient sleep could do over years. It likely contributes to faster accumulation of senescent cells or a more pronounced inflammaging state. Therefore, a key part of a longevity lifestyle is to **get 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night** (for most adults) and maintain a consistent sleep schedule that aligns with natural circadian rhythms.

In a podcast, after the host mentioned the sleep deprivation study, Campisi expanded on the **“lifestyle approach”** to controlling the SASP, which includes **“getting adequate sleep”** alongside exercise and diet ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=inflammatory%20molecules%20that%20are%20being,job%20at%20reducing%20senescent%20cells)) ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=Judith%20Campisi%20,really%20beneficial%20longterm%20for%20multiple)). She confirmed that ensuring proper sleep “undoubtedly will help” reduce the harmful secretions of senescent cells and benefit overall health ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=Judith%20Campisi%20,really%20beneficial%20longterm%20for%20multiple)). Adequate sleep is essentially a **preventative measure** – it keeps your stress hormones lower, supports DNA repair at night, and prevents the immune dysfunction that arises from insomnia. All these are important for healthy aging.

Moreover, during deep sleep, the brain and body undergo critical maintenance (for example, the brain’s glymphatic system clears out waste products during slow-wave sleep). Good sleep might aid in clearing molecular junk that otherwise contributes to aging. While Campisi didn’t directly discuss glymphatic clearance, it aligns with her general theme that the body has built-in cleanup mechanisms (like autophagy, immune surveillance) which we should support through healthy behaviors. Sleep is a time when autophagy (cellular self-cleaning) is active, growth hormone is secreted (aiding tissue repair), and systemic inflammation goes down. So from an aging standpoint, **sleep is when your body repairs damage** accrued during the day, potentially preventing some cells from entering senescence.

Campisi also notes that lack of sleep is **pro-inflammatory**. One can measure increases in inflammatory cytokines and even something like NF-κB activation (a key inflammatory switch in cells) after sleep loss. Therefore, chronic sleep deprivation could mimic some aspects of aging on a molecular level – raising inflammatory cytokines similar to what senescent cells do. By getting proper sleep, you keep those inflammation levels lower on a daily basis, presumably slowing the rate of “inflammaging.”

Interestingly, some longevity researchers who Campisi is acquainted with (like Dr. Aubrey de Grey) have admitted to not sleeping enough because of work, but they acknowledge this is not healthy ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=hasten%20the%20development%20of%20new,%E2%80%9D)). Campisi has a more balanced view: she works very hard but doesn’t explicitly advocate sacrificing sleep for productivity. On the contrary, she highlights the science that **sleep is health-protective**. It’s likely that she herself, as a scientist, tries to get decent sleep (though the demands of research can challenge that). 

For the general public, her advice is implicit but clear: **Make sleep a priority**. This means practicing good sleep hygiene – keeping a regular bedtime, sleeping in a dark, quiet environment, managing caffeine/alcohol timing, and addressing issues like sleep apnea if they exist. The payoff is better cellular health. By sleeping well, you allow your cells to recover, which in turn may mean fewer cells reach a senescent state prematurely.

In summary, Campisi’s stance is that **adequate sleep is a key (and often underappreciated) longevity factor**. She includes it among the core lifestyle interventions one should optimize, alongside diet and exercise, to suppress chronic inflammation and age more slowly ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=inflammatory%20molecules%20that%20are%20being,job%20at%20reducing%20senescent%20cells)) ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=Judith%20Campisi%20,really%20beneficial%20longterm%20for%20multiple)). Conversely, she warns that poor sleep habits will undermine other longevity efforts by exacerbating stress at the cellular level. 

### Embracing Healthy Stress and Mental Engagement

When it comes to psychological and emotional factors, Dr. Campisi has a nuanced take on **stress**. We often hear that stress is bad for aging – and it’s true that chronic, uncontrolled stress (especially psychosocial stress) can shorten lifespan. However, Campisi distinguishes between **toxic stress** and **productive stress**. In her own life, she actually attributes some of her vitality to the fact that she **embraces stress** rather than avoids it ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=Only%20slightly%20tongue,of%2C%20say%2C%20a%20Syrian%20refugee)). That might sound counterintuitive, but she’s referring to **mental challenges and pressures** that come with doing work you’re passionate about, as opposed to life-or-death stress or trauma.

Campisi says rather than avoiding stress entirely, she believes in **challenging the brain with stress to keep it young** ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=Only%20slightly%20tongue,death)). For example, the stress of meeting a research deadline, solving a tough scientific problem, or managing a busy lab – these are not relaxations, but they are the kind of stress that **stimulates the mind**. She notes that staying busy with meaningful work forces you to continuously learn and adapt, which may have cognitive benefits (like building cognitive reserve) that persist into older age. It’s akin to the saying “use it or lose it” for the brain. By constantly using her brain under some pressure, she keeps it sharp. She quips that she hasn’t taken a vacation since 2009 because she doesn’t feel the need to sit on a beach for two weeks – she’d be “bored to death” ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=stress%20of%2C%20say%2C%20a%20Syrian,refugee))! This illustrates how much she thrives on being actively engaged and challenged. 

Now, Campisi is **quick to clarify** that the kind of stress she “embraces” is **not the extreme, traumatic stress** that is obviously harmful. She explicitly says she’s *not* talking about the life-or-death stress of, say, a war zone or being a refugee ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=avoiding%20stress%2C%20Campisi%20says%20she,of%2C%20say%2C%20a%20Syrian%20refugee)). Those kinds of severe chronic stresses release cortisol and adrenaline in excess and can wreak havoc on the body (shortening telomeres, impairing immune function, etc.). Instead, she’s talking about **“the kind of pressure inherent in the life of a busy scientist”** ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=avoiding%20stress%2C%20Campisi%20says%20she,of%2C%20say%2C%20a%20Syrian%20refugee)) – which might be analogous to the pressures many people have in careers or challenging projects. This kind of stress is typically intermittent, bounded by the context of work or personal goals, and often paired with a sense of purpose or excitement.

In fact, Campisi’s point aligns with a broader concept in gerontology: **having a purpose and staying engaged** is strongly linked to longevity. People who continue to have goals, passions, and moderate challenges in older age tend to live longer and healthier. Campisi herself says **“having passions is healthy”** ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=glass%20of%20good%20wine%20whenever,passions%20is%20healthy%2C%20she%20says)). Her passion happens to be science, and it involves intellectual stress – but it gives her life meaning and keeps her mentally active. So her recommendation could be interpreted as: **find your passion or purpose and pursue it, even if it’s challenging – it will keep you young at heart and mind.** For some, that might be a hobby, for others volunteering or a second career; for Campisi, it’s scientific research.

There’s also a physiological angle: **short-term stress can be hormetic** for the brain and body. For example, taking on a challenging mental task or even experiencing acute but transient stress can lead to adaptive responses (like increased neurotrophic factors in the brain, which improve neuron health). Campisi’s attitude suggests she believes in leveraging this hormesis. The key is that it should be **stress that you have some control over and that has a positive outcome** (e.g., solving a problem, achieving something) rather than feeling helpless. The stress of a difficult puzzle that you eventually solve is stimulating and satisfying; the stress of an overwhelming situation with no end in sight is damaging. Campisi stays on the stimulating side of that equation.

In interviews, Campisi has humorously cited **“worrying”** as part of her routine – implying she’s always thinking about problems to solve. Again, this is tongue-in-cheek, but it underlines that her mind is always active. She doesn’t promote chronic anxiety; rather, she acknowledges that **her drive and concern (for her work, for doing good science) keeps her going** ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=Only%20slightly%20tongue,of%2C%20say%2C%20a%20Syrian%20refugee)). In a way, this is about mindset: she doesn’t stress out *about* aging, she directs her stress towards productive ends. “I’m too busy [to worry about my own aging],” she says ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=Judith%20Campisi%2C%20who%20is%20in,may%20be%20leading%20to%20disease)), which might be a lesson to all of us – staying busy with things you care about can keep you from stewing in negative stress or loneliness.

On the flip side, Campisi would certainly agree that **chronic unmanaged stress is harmful**. Constant psychological stress can increase systemic inflammation (via cortisol and other pathways), which could accelerate the aging of the immune system and promote senescent cell formation. So managing stress is crucial. Some ways to manage it include exercise (which she already advocates), meditation or relaxation techniques (which she hasn’t specifically mentioned but are well-known aids), and social support (having a network of colleagues, friends, like she likely does in science). Campisi’s personal method seems to be immersing herself in work she finds meaningful – an approach that might not work for everyone, but the underlying principle of *finding fulfilling engagement* can apply universally.

It’s also important to note that she values **resilience**. By continuously handling stressors, one can build resilience. Her career trajectory (for example, pushing a then-controversial hypothesis about senescence in the 1990s ([Judith Campisi Cracks the Code on Aging - Haute Living San Francisco](https://www.hautelivingsf.com/2023/07/10/judith-campisi-cracks-the-code-on-aging/#:~:text=her%20mentor%2C%20Arthur%20Pardee%2C%20urged,of%20disease%20as%20we%20age)) ([Judith Campisi Cracks the Code on Aging - Haute Living San Francisco](https://www.hautelivingsf.com/2023/07/10/judith-campisi-cracks-the-code-on-aging/#:~:text=how%20was%20yet%20to%20be,aging%20is%20about%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20said))) shows she isn’t afraid of challenges. Translating that into advice: don’t shy away from challenges or learning new things in your later years. That cognitive and psychological engagement is likely beneficial for longevity.

In summary, Dr. Campisi’s approach to stress can be summarized as **embrace beneficial stress, avoid destructive stress**. Beneficial stress includes intellectual challenges, exercise, and other forms of hormesis – these keep you adaptable and strong. Destructive stress (chronic despair, severe trauma) should be minimized or mitigated. Having a positive outlook toward manageable stress is part of her longevity mindset. As she said, *“Challenging the brain with stress keeps it young”* ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=Only%20slightly%20tongue,death)) – so continue to learn, work on passions, and engage with life’s puzzles. At the same time, ensure you get recovery (sleep, relaxation) so that stress doesn’t become unrelenting.

### Social Connection and Passions

Although not heavily discussed by Campisi in technical terms, she indirectly touches on the importance of **social connections and passions** for healthy aging. In the Medium interview, after mentioning wine, she said “having passions is healthy” ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=glass%20of%20good%20wine%20whenever,passions%20is%20healthy%2C%20she%20says)). We can extrapolate that building relationships around those passions (like she enjoys meeting winemakers and presumably enjoys collegial relationships in science) contributes to mental and emotional well-being. While she didn’t explicitly say “stay socially connected” in the sources we have, it’s a common theme among longevity researchers. Campisi’s own life – vigorously collaborating with other scientists, mentoring protégés (like Marco Demaria, whom she trained ([January Longevity Research Newsletter](https://www.vitadao.com/blog-article/january-longevity-research-newsletter-2#:~:text=Welcome%20back%20Vitalians,of%20her%20prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9s%2C%20Marco%20Demaria))), and engaging with the broader community (speaking at conferences, serving on boards) – exemplifies staying connected and contributing to society. This kind of social and intellectual engagement is a known predictor of longevity.

We might recall that in one blog (Stride), another person (not Campisi) noted the importance of elders staying engaged and how inspiring elders often “have a desire to continue to be engaged and make a contribution” ([It’s time to start embracing longevity — Stride Blog](https://blog.stridehealth.com/post/embracing-longevity#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20currently%20volunteer%20at%20a,%E2%80%9D)). This sentiment mirrors Campisi’s life. So while she doesn’t give “social advice” per se, by example she shows that **remaining active in the community and pursuing one’s passions** is part of a long, healthy life.

To sum up Campisi’s non-biological advice: **Get good sleep, and keep your life filled with purpose, challenge, and engagement.** Avoid chronic stressors that you can’t control, but don’t retire your brain or passions in the name of an easy life. A bit of **pressure and excitement** can keep you youthful. As Campisi herself said, she has no desire to retire to a life of total leisure – staying busy (with things she loves) is her anti-aging secret ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=stress%20of%2C%20say%2C%20a%20Syrian,refugee)). And of course, balance that active life with restorative sleep and relaxation when needed. This balance of effort and recovery mirrors her overall approach to aging: a cyclical process of stress and repair (just like exercise and fasting stress the body and then the body recovers stronger, mental/work stress followed by rest can strengthen the mind).

> – **Nutrition:** Eat a balanced diet; include plant foods rich in anti-inflammatory compounds. Avoid overeating and empty calories.

Following these lifestyle practices lays the groundwork for longevity. On top of this solid foundation, Dr. Campisi also discusses **supplements and emerging medical interventions** that might give extra boosts to healthspan. In the next sections, we’ll look at her recommendations on supplements like NAD boosters and flavonoids, as well as drugs like senolytics, rapamycin, and metformin that are being explored for aging interventions.

## Supplements and Nutraceuticals for Longevity

Dr. Campisi generally approaches supplements with scientific caution – she does not endorse a plethora of pills for everyone, especially in the absence of solid evidence. In fact, she has noted that many purported anti-aging supplements may do “very little good” compared to the basics of diet and exercise ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=Aubrey%20de%20Grey%20insists%20that,His%20devotion%20to)). However, there are a few specific compounds that pique her interest due to their biochemical effects on aging pathways. These often come from research findings in her field. Notably, Campisi has mentioned certain **flavonoids** (plant-derived compounds) and **NAD⁺ precursors** as potentially beneficial supplements for targeting aging mechanisms. 

Here we compile the supplements and nutraceuticals Campisi has explicitly discussed:

### Flavonoids and Natural Senolytic Compounds

**Flavonoids** are a class of polyphenolic compounds found in many fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Some flavonoids have gained attention as **senolytic or “senomorphic” agents**, meaning they might help eliminate senescent cells or modulate their harmful secretions. Dr. Campisi has directly talked about three in particular: **Quercetin, Fisetin, and Apigenin**.

- **Quercetin:** Quercetin is found in foods like apples, onions, capers, and many berries. It was one of the first compounds identified (along with a chemotherapy drug dasatinib) to selectively kill senescent cells in preclinical studies. Campisi notes that quercetin **suppresses some parts of the SASP** (the inflammatory factors from senescent cells) ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=Judith%20Campisi%20,really%20beneficial%20longterm%20for%20multiple)). While quercetin alone may not be a potent senolytic in humans (the combination of dasatinib + quercetin showed senolytic activity in mice), it does have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects that could improve the tissue environment. Campisi’s lab and others have observed that quercetin can dial down certain SASP factors like IL-6 in cell culture ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=Judith%20Campisi%20,two%20specific%20indicators%20of%20health)). In a podcast, when asked if regular consumption of flavonols like quercetin could help with senescent cells, Campisi responded, “That undoubtedly will help,” though she cautioned it may not eliminate the problem entirely ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=Judith%20Campisi%20,really%20beneficial%20longterm%20for%20multiple)). The takeaway is that quercetin is a promising natural compound to include in one’s diet or supplement regimen for its **senomorphic** (senescence-modulating) properties.

- **Fisetin:** Fisetin is another flavonoid, abundant in strawberries and present in smaller amounts in other fruits like persimmons and mangoes. Fisetin made headlines in aging research when a Mayo Clinic study showed that high-dose fisetin extended healthspan and lifespan in old mice, apparently by clearing senescent cells. Campisi has mentioned fisetin alongside quercetin as a flavonoid that can target senescent cells ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=enhances%20the%20senescence,job%20at%20reducing%20senescent%20cells)). Like quercetin, fisetin has been shown to reduce markers of senescence and inflammation in animal studies. Some human pilot studies are underway testing fisetin as a senolytic supplement (e.g., for osteoarthritis and metabolic syndrome). While Campisi hasn’t given a personal endorsement like “take fisetin daily,” her inclusion of it in discussions suggests she sees it as one of the more compelling over-the-counter options for those looking to experiment with senolytics in a safe way. It’s a naturally occurring compound with low toxicity, so among supplements, fisetin stands out. In absence of formal guidance, some longevity enthusiasts take fisetin in “senolytic doses” (e.g., 20 mg per kg of body weight for a couple of days per month) – this protocol arose from animal study scaling. Campisi hasn’t confirmed such a regimen, but the fact that her lab colleagues are researching it implies it’s on her radar as a useful compound.

- **Apigenin:** Apigenin is found in parsley, chamomile tea, and celery. It hasn’t been as publicized as quercetin or fisetin, but Campisi specifically brought it up by name in one interview ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=enhances%20the%20senescence,job%20at%20reducing%20senescent%20cells)). She mentioned apigenin in the context of compounds that suppress aspects of the SASP. In fact, Campisi collaborated on a study of a formulated compound called “Apigenin-derived small molecules” (one was dubbed “Apogenin” in the interview, likely a derivative of apigenin) aimed at mitigating senescent cell factors ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=enhances%20the%20senescence,molecules%2C%20would%20the%20regular%20consumption)). Apigenin is known to have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties; it can influence pathways like NF-κB and others that senescent cells use to secrete inflammatory signals. Campisi’s comment that “I know that you had a study on Apogen” suggests that research is ongoing to optimize apigenin or similar molecules for therapeutic use ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=enhances%20the%20senescence,molecules%2C%20would%20the%20regular%20consumption)). For now, one could get apigenin naturally by drinking chamomile tea or taking a parsley supplement. While not proven in humans, Campisi’s interest indicates it could be part of a **“stack” of natural compounds to reduce senescent cell burden**.

It’s important to note Campisi’s **cautious optimism** about these flavonoids. She does believe they each help “suppress some parts” of the senescent cell’s bad behavior ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=Judith%20Campisi%20,two%20specific%20indicators%20of%20health)), but she also clearly states that none of them (alone or together) is known to be sufficiently powerful to completely prevent aging. They **“don’t suppress it all,”** she says of the SASP, and it’s **“a big unanswered question”** whether these natural compounds are potent enough in humans to significantly impact long-term health ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=this%20senescence,bet%20would%20be%20to%20get)). Thus, she does not portray them as magic anti-aging pills, but rather as potentially **beneficial supplements** that likely have low risk. She notes that they are “potentially safer” interventions (being natural products) and warrant further study ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=indicators%20of%20health%20as%20opposed,still%20needs%20to%20be%20determined)). 

Campisi suggests an ideal future might involve using these kinds of compounds in conjunction with other therapies: perhaps using a pharmaceutical senolytic infrequently to kill senescent cells, and using flavonoid supplements more continuously to keep the remaining senescent cells quiet (less inflammatory) ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=probably%20100%20molecules%2C%20maybe%20more,interrogate%20those%20potentially%20safer%2C%20meaning)) ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=them%20to%20die%2C%20the%20cells,still%20needs%20to%20be%20determined)). Until senolytic drugs are widely available, people interested in longevity might choose to incorporate supplements like quercetin and fisetin as a stop-gap measure. Campisi herself has not publicly stated if she personally takes these supplements, but given her discussions, she likely would not discourage a healthy person from taking them in moderation, as long as they understand the limitations.

Beyond flavonoids, other plant compounds and supplements often discussed in the longevity community include **curcumin** (from turmeric), **EGCG** (from green tea), and **resveratrol** (from red wine/grapes). Campisi hasn’t been quoted specifically on these, but they share a theme: anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and possibly affecting cellular stress pathways. She would likely put them in the category of “might help, won’t hurt (much).” In general, antioxidants were historically thought to be anti-aging, but Campisi is aware (as most scientists are now) that flooding the body with antioxidants isn’t a proven strategy – it might even interfere with some beneficial stress signals. Instead, compounds like the flavonoids mentioned seem to work not purely as direct antioxidants but by influencing gene expression and cell signaling (for example, quercetin can modulate kinases and transcription factors). 

**Dosage and usage:** Campisi hasn’t given dosing advice. However, typical supplement doses used in studies are: quercetin 500–1000 mg/day, fisetin 100 mg/day (or higher in short bursts for senolytic effect), apigenin 50 mg/day or so. It’s always best to get some from whole foods: eat your fruits and veggies (Campisi would certainly agree with that). If supplementing, one should be mindful of quality and consult healthcare providers. Campisi’s own statements suggest a balance: these are promising, but we “simply don’t know” yet if they’re strong enough ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=probably%20100%20molecules%2C%20maybe%20more,bet%20would%20be%20to%20get)). 

In summary, **Campisi highlights certain flavonoid supplements (quercetin, fisetin, apigenin)** as useful tools to possibly mitigate aging processes. They can reduce inflammatory signals from senescent cells and might even help eliminate some of them. While not a panacea, they are among the few supplements for which there is a mechanistic rationale in the context of her research. Therefore, someone following Campisi’s advice might incorporate these supplements (or the foods containing them) as part of a longevity regimen – with the understanding that they are adjuncts to, not replacements for, the core lifestyle practices.

### NAD⁺ Boosters (Nicotinamide Riboside / NMN)

Another category of nutraceuticals Dr. Campisi has addressed involves compounds that restore cellular **NAD⁺ levels**. NAD⁺ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a vital coenzyme in metabolism and DNA repair. NAD⁺ tends to decline with age, which has been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and increased cell senescence. Boosting NAD⁺ is an active area of longevity research (popularized by scientists like David Sinclair). Campisi has mentioned NAD⁺ metabolism in the context of preventing senescence: for instance, improving the **NAD⁺:NADH ratio** can support mitochondrial health and DNA repair, thus possibly staving off some cellular aging ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=Some%20of%20the%20factors%20contributing,to%20keep%20up%20with%20damage)).

Specifically, Campisi notes that the **NAD⁺/NADH ratio** can be altered by diet and supplements. In an interview, she cited that this ratio “has recently been shown to be improved by certain dietary supplements like **nicotinamide riboside**” ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=Some%20of%20the%20factors%20contributing,to%20keep%20up%20with%20damage)). **Nicotinamide riboside (NR)** is a form of vitamin B3 that serves as a precursor to NAD⁺. Likewise, **nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)** is another NAD⁺ precursor often discussed (NMN is one step further down the biochemical pathway from NR). By taking NR or NMN, one can increase NAD⁺ levels in tissues, at least according to multiple studies in both animals and humans.

Campisi’s mention of NR is telling – she is aware of research (including a 2018 Nature paper she alluded to ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=Some%20of%20the%20factors%20contributing,to%20keep%20up%20with%20damage))) that showed giving NR to older animals improved some aspects of their physiology by raising NAD⁺. She points out this connection while explaining factors that drive senescence: **mitochondrial dysfunction** is one, and it is “driven by an altered NAD:NADH ratio,” which in turn can be ameliorated by NAD⁺ precursors ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=Some%20of%20the%20factors%20contributing,to%20keep%20up%20with%20damage)). This implies that she sees NAD⁺ boosters as a logical intervention to counter one cause of cellular aging.

So, does Campisi recommend taking NAD⁺ supplements? While she hasn’t been as direct about “I take NMN” or such in public, her scientific commentary is favorable toward them. She includes NR among interventions that have notable effects on fundamental aging biochemistry ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=damage%20to%20our%20DNA%20and,to%20keep%20up%20with%20damage)). It’s reasonable to conclude that she would list **NR/NMN supplementation as a promising approach** to improve healthspan, especially since they may help maintain the activity of important enzymes like sirtuins and PARPs (which require NAD⁺ to function in DNA repair and epigenetic regulation). In fact, she notes that NAD⁺ is a substrate for PARP enzymes which repair DNA single-strand breaks ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=damage%20to%20our%20DNA%20and,to%20keep%20up%20with%20damage)). As we age, DNA damage accumulates partly because our repair enzymes can’t keep up; providing more NAD⁺ might enhance DNA repair capacity, thus lowering the burden of damage that can make cells senescent.

Between NR and NMN, Campisi specifically cited **nicotinamide riboside** ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=damage%20to%20our%20DNA%20and,to%20keep%20up%20with%20damage)), likely because that supplement has been through more clinical studies and was on the market earlier. NMN is very similar in effect (NMN actually converts into NR in the body, which then converts to NAD⁺). In recent times, NMN gained popularity but also faced regulatory hurdles (the FDA in the U.S. recently indicated NMN may become a drug ingredient, thus questioning its supplement status). Campisi hasn’t commented on that aspect – her focus is on the biology.

For someone looking to follow her science-based advice: **taking an NAD⁺ precursor supplement could be beneficial for longevity**. Typical doses used in studies are 250–300 mg/day for NR (some take up to 500–1000 mg) and around 500 mg/day for NMN, often in the morning (because NAD⁺ is tied to circadian rhythms). These supplements are generally considered safe (short-term studies show few adverse effects beyond maybe mild flushing for NR or improvements in some metabolic markers). Campisi would likely advise that maintaining NAD⁺ levels supports cell metabolism and **may slow some aspects of aging** – albeit she’d be the first to admit it’s not fully proven to extend lifespan in humans yet. It’s one of those **“modifiable pathways”** she aims to target to mitigate basic aging processes ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=cellular%20senescence%20%E2%80%93%20a%20state,associated%20secretory%20phenotype%2C%20or)) ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=In%20this%20episode%2C%20Dr,drugs%20that%20kill%20senescent%20cells)).

Another way to boost NAD⁺ without supplements is through **exercise and fasting**, which we already know she recommends. Both those activities have been shown to naturally increase NAD⁺ levels and activate sirtuins. So again, supplements are an adjunct, not a replacement, for the lifestyle measures.

In summary, Campisi identifies **NAD⁺ boosters (like nicotinamide riboside)** as a noteworthy supplement that can improve cellular health by enhancing DNA repair and mitochondrial function ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=Some%20of%20the%20factors%20contributing,to%20keep%20up%20with%20damage)). Taking NR or NMN could be part of a longevity protocol to support these pathways. She presents it as an example of how understanding aging mechanisms (like the NAD decline) leads to practical interventions (taking NAD precursors) that might **extend healthspan**. For someone reading her advice: considering an NAD⁺ supplement could be worthwhile, especially in middle age and beyond when NAD⁺ naturally falls.

### Other Supplements and Considerations

Beyond flavonoids and NAD precursors, Dr. Campisi doesn’t frequently promote many specific vitamins or supplements. She has not, for instance, singled out vitamins like D or K2, or minerals, in the sources we have. This doesn’t mean they are unimportant – Vitamin D in particular is known to support healthy aging and reduce inflammation. Campisi simply hasn’t been quoted on it directly. It’s likely she would agree that maintaining adequate Vitamin D (through sunlight or supplements) is beneficial, given its ties to immune function and possibly lower senescence (some studies indicate vitamin D can reduce senescent cell burden in cultures of certain cell types). But since she hasn’t explicitly said it, we won’t ascribe that recommendation to her here.

Another popular category in longevity circles is **omega-3 fatty acids** (fish oil). While Campisi hasn’t voiced advice on omega-3 in our references, it’s well known omega-3s are anti-inflammatory. A diet with good omega-3:6 ratio (e.g., more fish, less seed oils) complements the anti-inflammaging approach she espouses. We might assume she’d be supportive of any supplement or diet change that safely reduces chronic inflammation, since inflammaging is a target.

**Antioxidant supplements**: Interestingly, Campisi’s research has helped shift thinking *away* from simplistic antioxidant approaches (because oxidative stress theory alone didn’t explain aging). There’s no record of her recommending high-dose antioxidants like vitamin E or C supplements for longevity. In fact, given the nuanced understanding now, she might caution that taking large doses of antioxidants could blunt the hormetic benefits of exercise, for example. It’s better to get antioxidants from food, which come packaged with other beneficial molecules. So while not explicitly stated by her, the implication is to not over-supplement antioxidants thinking it’s an anti-aging cure – focus more on the **body’s own stress response** (which is improved by exercise, fasting, etc.). 

**Multivitamins or other general supplements**: Campisi hasn’t discussed these either. Generally, in a well-nourished person, a multivitamin might not make a big difference for aging, except to prevent deficiencies that would certainly harm healthspan. Her advice would likely be: if you have a known deficiency (say B12, iron, etc.), correct it. Otherwise, there’s no special longevity cocktail proven yet, aside from the things we’ve covered.

**Summary of Campisi’s stance on supplements:** She is selective and evidence-driven. The ones she explicitly mentions – quercetin, fisetin, apigenin, nicotinamide riboside – are all tied to her scientific understanding of aging pathways (senescence and metabolism). These form a kind of “longevity supplement stack” that addresses inflammaging and mitochondrial health. Campisi views them as helpful but not all-powerful. They should be used to **supplement** (hence the name) a healthy lifestyle, not to compensate for a poor lifestyle. And future research might bring new supplements to light; for example, her lab’s work on SASP factors could identify other natural inhibitors of those factors.

One more point: Campisi is a co-editor of the journal *Aging* and stays current on supplement research. If any supplement showed real anti-aging efficacy in humans, she’d surely know. As of now, her measured recommendations indicate that **no supplement replaces exercise or diet, but a few can add incremental benefits**. 

To an average person reading her advice, a sensible approach would be: eat a varied diet rich in polyphenols (fruits, veggies, teas), consider taking a daily NAD⁺ booster, and possibly do periodic courses of senolytic-type supplements like fisetin (some enthusiasts do 2–3 day high-dose fisetin “cleanses” once a month). Always pay attention to your body’s response and consult with a physician if needed, since these supplements, while generally safe, are still being studied for long-term use.

In the next section, we’ll move from the over-the-counter world to the realm of pharmaceuticals – discussing Campisi’s perspective on drugs like senolytics, rapamycin, and metformin that are at the forefront of longevity research.

## Pharmacological Interventions Targeting Aging

Dr. Campisi’s contributions to aging science have directly inspired new pharmacological approaches to extend healthspan. She is a strong proponent of developing **drugs that target fundamental aging processes** – especially drugs to eliminate or neutralize senescent cells, known as **senolytics** or **senomorphics**. While many of these interventions are still experimental, Campisi has shared her insights and hopes about how they might be used to improve human healthspan. In public forums, she often discusses three main categories of pharmacological interventions: **senolytic drugs**, **mTOR inhibitors like rapamycin**, and **other repurposed drugs (such as metformin and statins)**.

It’s important to note that Campisi does **not** tell healthy individuals to run out and start taking these drugs today (outside of clinical trials or doctor supervision). Rather, she speaks about them as emerging therapies that, with more research and testing, could become part of the longevity toolbox. She provides context on how they work and what evidence exists. Below, we summarize her commentary and advice regarding each type of drug.

### Senolytic Drugs – Clearing Senescent Cells

Given Judith Campisi’s pioneering role in linking senescent cells to aging, it’s no surprise that she is a major advocate for **senolytic drugs** – therapies designed to selectively destroy senescent cells or otherwise remove their harmful influence. She co-founded **Unity Biotechnology**, a biotech company specifically to develop senolytic drugs for age-related diseases ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=Buck%20Institute%20for%20Research%20on,may%20be%20leading%20to%20disease)) ([«Creer que alargaremos la vida 500 años se basa en la fe, no en datos» - MIT Technology Review en español](https://technologyreview.es/article/creer-que-alargaremos-la-vida-500-anos-se-basa-en-la-fe-no-en-datos/#:~:text=As%C3%AD%20es%20como%2C%20en%20los,de%20su%20primer%20f%C3%A1rmaco%20senol%C3%ADtico)). This speaks volumes: she helped start a company (and served as its scientific advisor) with the mission to “eliminate cells that have stopped dividing and may be leading to disease” ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=Buck%20Institute%20for%20Research%20on,may%20be%20leading%20to%20disease)). Unity began human trials of a senolytic compound (UBX0101) for osteoarthritis in 2018 ([«Creer que alargaremos la vida 500 años se basa en la fe, no en datos» - MIT Technology Review en español](https://technologyreview.es/article/creer-que-alargaremos-la-vida-500-anos-se-basa-en-la-fe-no-en-datos/#:~:text=As%C3%AD%20es%20como%2C%20en%20los,de%20su%20primer%20f%C3%A1rmaco%20senol%C3%ADtico)), and while that particular trial did not succeed as hoped, the effort marked a new chapter in geriatric medicine – directly targeting the biology of aging in a clinical trial.

**Campisi’s rationale for senolytics:** If senescent cells drive many aspects of aging and pathology, then getting rid of them should alleviate multiple age-related problems at once. In one interview, she explained that a senolytic drug might not make a human live to 5000 years, “**but it might help attack several problems of aging** – like Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s – that involve a lot of inflammation,” by addressing their common cause ([Ask the Experts: Can Aging Be Controlled? | Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/aging-ask-the-experts-can-aging-be-controlled/#:~:text=Do%20I%20think%20if%20I,the%20underlying%20processes%2C%20like%20inflammation)). The idea is to treat the **“underlying processes”** (such as chronic inflammation and tissue degeneration from senescent cells) rather than treating each age-related disease separately in silos ([Ask the Experts: Can Aging Be Controlled? | Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/aging-ask-the-experts-can-aging-be-controlled/#:~:text=make%20a%20human%20live%20for,the%20underlying%20processes%2C%20like%20inflammation)). This is a paradigm shift: use one therapy to prevent or ameliorate many diseases at once by acting on aging itself.

Campisi’s optimism for senolytics is balanced with realism. She frequently notes that senescence is only one driver of aging (though a big one), so senolytics won’t stop aging entirely, but they could **extend healthspan significantly**. In mice, proof-of-concept studies showed that genetically removing senescent cells extended median lifespan by ~30% and made the mice healthier (improved organ function, fewer tumors, etc.). Campisi often references these foundational experiments (e.g., by van Deursen’s group) to illustrate the potential: clearing senescent cells in mice “can extend lifespan” and even partially reverse certain aspects of aging ([

Her own work demonstrated that administering senolytics or senomorphics (drugs that suppress the SASP) in animal models can **improve tissue function even later in life** ([

That means it’s not too late to intervene in middle or old age – a crucial point for human translation.

For humans, Campisi envisions senolytics might be used in a **periodic dosing schedule** rather than continuously. She has explained that unlike drugs for blood pressure which you take daily, senolytics might be given once in a while to purge senescent cells and then not again until they build up some more ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=match%20at%20L294%20to%20simply,are%20not%20ready%20for%20prime)) ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity.

This intermittent dosing is a safer strategy because you minimize exposure (and potential side effects). Campisi says, **“the idea is that you would not have to take this drug every day, but take it once in a while and then, slowly, as senescent cells build up, you take it again”** ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=match%20at%20L294%20to%20simply,are%20not%20ready%20for%20prime)) ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity.

This echoes the fasting approach – periodic clean-up. She believes this *“is the promise of the future”* for senolytic therapy ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=to%20simply%20go%20away,are%20not%20ready%20for%20prime)).

In interviews, Campisi has been asked if any senolytic trials are happening in humans. As of a few years ago, she noted that human trials were imminent, saying “to my knowledge, there are no human trials yet... Some of the tests are at that stage (animal), not yet in humans. The hope is that there will be something in humans relatively soon, some estimates are within a year or so” ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=clearing%20senescent%20cells%20in%20some,form)). Indeed, since then, several small trials have started – for example, using the dasatinib+quercetin combination in diabetic kidney disease and lung fibrosis, and other companies testing compounds in eye disease and neurodegeneration. Unity’s trial, as mentioned, was one of the first. Although Unity’s osteoarthritis senolytic didn’t show efficacy in the initial trial, Campisi remains upbeat that it’s “very new, exciting (and somewhat controversial) research that will advance dramatically in our lifetimes” ([It’s time to start embracing longevity — Stride Blog](https://blog.stridehealth.com/post/embracing-longevity#:~:text=of%20time%20to%20control%20blood,%E2%80%9D)). She expects that while we “may not be able to postpone death,” we **“may be able to preserve health until such time that you die catastrophically”** (i.e., suddenly at the end, rather than a slow decline) ([It’s time to start embracing longevity — Stride Blog](https://blog.stridehealth.com/post/embracing-longevity#:~:text=While%20Dr,health%20damage%2C%20but%20something%20unforeseen)). Senolytics are central to achieving that vision of compressing morbidity.

For those wondering if any senolytic agents can be used now: currently, the known senolytic cocktail from animal studies is **Dasatinib + Quercetin (D+Q)**. Dasatinib is a prescription leukemia drug; quercetin is OTC. Some brave self-experimenters have tried D+Q off-label, but Campisi does not endorse unsupervised use of a cancer drug by healthy people – that would be risky. Instead, she would likely advise waiting for clinical trial results or to join a trial if available. However, she might give a nod to the idea of taking quercetin or fisetin alone as a gentler approach (as covered in the supplement section). **Fisetin** actually showed senolytic effects in mice on its own, and clinical trials with fisetin are ongoing. This is perhaps the closest thing to a “do-it-yourself senolytic” one might consider with informed caution. 

Campisi’s Unity Biotechnology and other companies are also exploring senolytics that are tissue-specific (e.g., UBX0101 injected into knees for arthritis, or UBX1325 for eye diseases). The strategy is to avoid systemic side effects by targeting where needed. Campisi has highlighted that one challenge is **delivery and measurement** – how do we measure that senolytics work in humans? She notes that aging isn’t yet seen as a disease by regulators, so trials have to target a specific disease and measure improvement there ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=to%20die,to%20be%20targeted%20to%20a)). She also mentions the need for biomarkers (her lab found some blood biomarkers for senescent cells, as we’ll discuss later) to know if senolytics are hitting their target ([

In terms of advice, what would Campisi say to an individual *right now* about senolytic drugs? Likely: **“Stay tuned.”** They are one of the most promising interventions on the horizon. She’s optimistic they will enter the clinic and could allow people to **periodically “clean out” senescent cells** to maintain tissue health ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=match%20at%20L294%20to%20simply,are%20not%20ready%20for%20prime)). For now, outside of clinical trials, her advice is not to take any senolytic drugs unsupervised – but one can mimic the effect in part with lifestyle (fasting, etc., which we covered). When senolytic drugs do become available and proven, her recommendation would likely be to incorporate them under medical guidance. For example, one could imagine in a decade or two, a 60-year-old goes to a clinic and gets a senolytic infusion once a year to reduce their biological age – that’s the kind of scenario Campisi’s work is paving the way for.

To use her own hopeful words: she envisions a future where therapies based on cellular senescence research (like senolytics) can **“slow down or even reverse aspects of aging, allowing people to lead more active, productive lives well into what we currently consider old age.”** ([

Until then, her focus is on continuing the research and carefully moving these drugs through trials.

### Rapamycin and mTOR Inhibition

Another major pharmacological approach in longevity science is targeting the **mTOR pathway**, and the prototypical drug for that is **Rapamycin**. Rapamycin (sirolimus) is an immunosuppressant drug (used for organ transplant patients) that, intriguingly, has been shown to extend lifespan in many organisms from yeast to mice. It works by inhibiting mTOR (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin), a key nutrient-sensing pathway that affects growth and aging. Dr. Campisi has discussed rapamycin in the context of how it interacts with cellular senescence and the SASP.

Campisi explains that rapamycin **“targets one arm of the TOR pathway”** and by doing so, it **suppresses primarily the inflammatory arm of the secretory phenotype of senescent cells** ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=drug%20rapamycin%2C%20which%20is%20known,could%20be%20that%20fasting%2C%20and)). In simpler terms: rapamycin doesn’t kill senescent cells, but it can **calm them down**, reducing the secretion of harmful inflammatory factors. This makes rapamycin a **senomorphic** agent (modulating senescent cell behavior) even if it’s not a senolytic (destroying the cells). She notes this distinction: “pharmacologically, drugs like rapamycin suppress the ability of senescent cells to secrete [inflammatory molecules], but don’t kill them – unlike senolytic drugs which actually kill senescent cells” ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=match%20at%20L930%20pharmacologically%20with,ability%20of%20the%20senescent%20cells)). Both strategies (senomorphic vs senolytic) can improve healthspan, but they work differently.

Given that rapamycin is already FDA-approved (for other indications) and has shown geroprotective effects in animal studies, many in the longevity community are excited about the idea of people taking low-dose rapamycin as a longevity drug. What’s Campisi’s view? She acknowledges rapamycin’s anti-aging potential: experiments have shown that giving mice rapamycin late in life can still extend their lifespan. However, she also is aware of the **side effects** (since rapamycin suppresses the immune system and can raise risk of infection or impact wound healing, etc.). Therefore, she often balances the conversation: rapamycin can mimic some effects of fasting on aging pathways, but one must be cautious with its use.

In her chat with Rhonda Patrick, Rhonda posited that maybe **short-term fasting might give more benefit than taking rapamycin which has side effects** ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=more%20benefit%20than%20taking%20a,rapamycin%20which%20has%20side%20effects)). Campisi seemed to agree with that line of reasoning. Fasting not only inhibits mTOR (like rapamycin does) but also triggers autophagy and clearance of damaged cells – *and* fasting doesn’t require putting a drug in your body. So, Campisi’s implicit advice here is: **if you can get the benefits of mTOR inhibition through fasting or diet, that might be preferable to chronic rapamycin use for now** ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=more%20benefit%20than%20taking%20a,rapamycin%20which%20has%20side%20effects)). 

That said, she does see a role for rapamycin or rapalogs (rapamycin-like drugs) potentially as an intermittent treatment. For example, a possible future protocol might be: take rapamycin at low dose intermittently to keep senescent cells tame and to boost autophagy, combined with occasional senolytics to remove cells, plus lifestyle measures. Campisi has noted that rapamycin’s effects on senescent cells (suppressing SASP) **last longer than the presence of the drug** – because it might interrupt some feedback loops in the SASP cascade ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=least%20your%20so,inflammatory%20secretory)) ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=match%20at%20L921%20rapamycin%2C%20and,Valter%20is%20a%20proponent%20of)). This is encouraging, meaning one might not need to take it continuously.

She also connected the dots that **fasting, rapamycin, and the SASP all converge on the mTOR pathway** ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=match%20at%20L921%20rapamycin%2C%20and,Valter%20is%20a%20proponent%20of)). The picture is: too much nutrient/energy (high mTOR activity) drives aging and SASP; restricting nutrients (via fasting or an mTOR inhibitor) slows aging and calms SASP. So, one can approach it via diet or drug or both. 

Has Campisi given a recommendation for rapamycin use? Not to the general public, no. Rapamycin is still a prescription drug with serious uses, and long-term safety of low-dose rapamycin in healthy people is not fully established (though trials like PEARL and others are in progress). She acknowledges it as one of the likely interventions to extend lifespan or healthspan in humans, but as a scientist, she’s waiting for more data. In the StrideHealth blog, they mention rapamycin as an example of a pharmacological treatment that alters senescent cell phenotype (this likely paraphrased Campisi’s points about rapamycin suppressing SASP). And indeed, the first human trial of rapamycin for anti-aging (the PEARL trial) is underway now. Until results are out, Campisi would likely not advise people to self-medicate with rapamycin.

However, it’s interesting that quite a few researchers and biohackers (including some of her colleagues) do take rapamycin weekly (e.g., 5-10 mg once a week) aiming for longevity benefits. We don’t know if Campisi ever did – she hasn’t said so. Given her focus on staying healthy and her interest in data, she might have opted not to take it outside of a trial because of the immune suppression issue, especially during times like the COVID-19 pandemic when strong immune function is crucial.

Her bottom-line advice on rapamycin would be: **rapamycin (or drugs that mimic it) may become valuable longevity therapies**, especially for reducing age-related inflammation. But until it’s proven and optimized, use lifestyle measures to get similar benefits. If someone is determined to consider rapamycin, it should be with medical supervision and understanding of risks (e.g., risk of infections or metabolic effects). Campisi would probably encourage participation in clinical studies to properly evaluate rapamycin’s effect on aging (for instance, trials measuring immune function in elderly on rapamycin or analogs like everolimus have shown rejuvenation of vaccine responses – promising results).

In summary, Campisi includes rapamycin in the suite of strategies to “mitigate basic aging processes” ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=cellular%20senescence%20%E2%80%93%20a%20state,associated%20secretory%20phenotype%2C%20or)) ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=In%20this%20episode%2C%20Dr,drugs%20that%20kill%20senescent%20cells)). She specifically notes its ability to target **mTOR**, thereby reducing the pro-inflammatory SASP from senescent cells ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=drug%20rapamycin%2C%20which%20is%20known,could%20be%20that%20fasting%2C%20and)). Her guidance would be to keep an eye on this area; rapamycin or next-generation mTOR inhibitors could be part of a future anti-aging prescription. At present, she’d likely say: **focus on natural mTOR modulation (like protein moderation, intermittent fasting)** unless you’re in a study or have a compelling reason to use rapamycin. The promise is real, but so are the side effects, and it’s all about the risk-benefit balance.

### Metformin and Other Repurposed Drugs

Campisi has also commented on some existing **safe medications** that show hints of broad anti-aging effects – the prime example being **Metformin**. Metformin is a widely used Type 2 diabetes drug that improves insulin sensitivity and has few serious side effects. Epidemiological observations have suggested that diabetics on metformin live longer and have lower incidence of some cancers and heart disease than even non-diabetics, raising the intriguing possibility that metformin has geroprotective properties. This has led to the planned **TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin)** trial in the U.S., which aims to see if metformin can delay the onset of multiple age-related diseases.

Dr. Campisi has cited metformin as one of those drugs that “could interfere with the aging process.” In the Stride blog interview, she noted that **metformin has shown hints of lowering other age-related diseases** in diabetics ([It’s time to start embracing longevity — Stride Blog](https://blog.stridehealth.com/post/embracing-longevity#:~:text=Dr,related%20diseases%20along%20with%20diabetes.%E2%80%9D)). She presents two hypotheses (both plausible): either (1) diabetics on metformin get fewer age-diseases simply because metformin is controlling their blood sugar and diabetes is a driver of those diseases, *or* (2) metformin has direct effects that “are suppressing the other age-related diseases along with diabetes” ([It’s time to start embracing longevity — Stride Blog](https://blog.stridehealth.com/post/embracing-longevity#:~:text=interfere%20with%20the%20aging%20process,related%20diseases%20along%20with%20diabetes.%E2%80%9D)). In other words, maybe metformin is acting on some underlying aging factor like inflammation or AMPK/mTOR pathways. 

Campisi describes this as an interesting finding but remains cautious: it’s “hints” not proof. Nonetheless, she includes it in the arsenal of potential longevity drugs. Given metformin’s long safety record and cheap cost, many longevity physicians and biohackers have already adopted it (some take 500–2000 mg daily for anti-aging, even if they’re not diabetic). Would Campisi recommend metformin to a non-diabetic person for longevity? She hasn’t explicitly said so, but her tone in discussing it is fairly positive, suggesting she thinks it’s at least a reasonable approach. It certainly falls under the “low-risk intervention that might yield benefit” category.

One could imagine Campisi saying: If you have metabolic syndrome or pre-diabetes, metformin would be a very sensible medication that might also slow aging processes. If you’re already very healthy, the benefit of metformin is less clear, but it could provide a small edge (e.g., reducing chronic glucose exposure, activating AMPK, mildly lowering mTOR – basically putting the body in a pseudo-fasted state). She would likely advise awaiting the results of the TAME trial for more evidence, but she is intrigued by metformin enough to mention it in interviews.

Another class of drugs she’s mentioned are **statins** – cholesterol-lowering medications. In the same Stride discussion, Campisi pointed out a curious statistic: “Women who are or have been on statins for a period of time have lower rates of breast cancer” ([It’s time to start embracing longevity — Stride Blog](https://blog.stridehealth.com/post/embracing-longevity#:~:text=Statins%20are%20another%20classic%20drug,%E2%80%9D)). This is an example of a drug meant for one thing (reducing cardiovascular risk) showing an association with another benefit (less cancer). She cautioned that it’s unclear if this is a causal link or correlation – it could be that lower cholesterol itself somehow reduces cancer risk, or it could be the statin has a separate action that is anti-tumor (statins do have anti-inflammatory and cell metabolism effects beyond just cholesterol). She said “it’s still unclear if there’s a link between cholesterol and breast cancer, or whether the drugs have beneficial side effects” ([It’s time to start embracing longevity — Stride Blog](https://blog.stridehealth.com/post/embracing-longevity#:~:text=Statins%20are%20another%20classic%20drug,%E2%80%9D)).

The significance of this observation in the longevity context is that some **existing drugs might have unexpected aging-related benefits**. Statins might slightly reduce cancer or other age-related disease incidence by reducing inflammation (CRP often goes down on statins) or improving blood vessel function. Campisi isn’t necessarily recommending statins for everyone – they do have side effects and are intended for those with high cardiovascular risk. But she uses it as an analogy: a drug targeting one aspect of aging (lipids) might cross-protect against another (cancer), meaning it’s affecting a common underlying factor (perhaps systemic inflammation or cell stress). This adds to her point that we might **repurpose old drugs** to target aging.

Other drugs sometimes floated in longevity discussions include **aspirin** (for its anti-inflammatory effects), **ACE inhibitors/ARBs** (blood pressure meds that in some studies appeared to improve aging markers), and newer diabetes drugs like **GLP-1 agonists** (which help weight loss and may improve cardiovascular health). Campisi hasn’t specifically talked about these in sources we have. She tends to focus on those with more direct evidence or mechanistic ties to senescence. Metformin and rapamycin, for instance, both can reduce the inflammatory SASP in cells and extend life in animals, making them prime candidates. Statins and aspirin reduce inflammation and are epidemiologically associated with less cancer or Alzheimer’s risk. While she hasn’t explicitly advised taking an aspirin a day for longevity, some researchers do (aspirin is tricky though, as its risks may outweigh benefits in healthy older adults per recent trials).

Campisi’s broader message here is: **Explore and leverage repurposed drugs that target aging pathways**. She said as much: her talk to a general audience touched on “prospects for new and repurposed therapies” for aging ([Expert Tip - Dr Judith Campisi - You Know the Answer - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx3baRZAoDQ#:~:text=YouTube%20www,distributed%20each%20week%20and)). She is part of the scientific advisory board for the Longevity community, so she’s well aware of the drug pipeline.

To summarize her advice on these pharmacological interventions:

- **Senolytics:** Extremely promising; likely to become a real option in the near future. For now, stick to natural senolytics like fisetin or wait for trials. When available, they might be used periodically to clean out senescent cells ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity. Podcast with Judith Campisi, PhD](https://humanos.me/blog-db/clearing-senescent-cells-for-health-and-longevity-podcast-with-judith-campisi-phd#:~:text=match%20at%20L294%20to%20simply,are%20not%20ready%20for%20prime)).
- **Rapamycin (mTOR inhibitors):** A powerful mechanism to slow aging, but current rapamycin has side effects. It may be worth it for some individuals (in clinical trials or under careful monitoring) – but one can mimic many effects via fasting/diet. In the future, rapamycin or better analogs might be used transiently to rejuvenate the body’s functional state ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=drug%20rapamycin%2C%20which%20is%20known,could%20be%20that%20fasting%2C%20and)) ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=more%20benefit%20than%20taking%20a,rapamycin%20which%20has%20side%20effects)).
- **Metformin:** Safe and possibly effective at delaying multiple age-related conditions. Campisi presents it as a plausible longevity drug that could “lower the incidence of other age-related diseases” beyond just treating diabetes ([It’s time to start embracing longevity — Stride Blog](https://blog.stridehealth.com/post/embracing-longevity#:~:text=Dr,related%20diseases%20along%20with%20diabetes.%E2%80%9D)). She seems to cautiously endorse the idea that it could extend healthspan, pending further studies. Many would interpret her commentary as a green light to using metformin for those with metabolic risk factors.
- **Other Geroprotective Drugs:** Campisi is intrigued by evidence that drugs like statins may confer extra benefits (like reduced cancer) ([It’s time to start embracing longevity — Stride Blog](https://blog.stridehealth.com/post/embracing-longevity#:~:text=Statins%20are%20another%20classic%20drug,%E2%80%9D)). Her advice here is not direct (“go take a statin to prevent cancer” is not something she’d say without clear evidence), but she uses these examples to illustrate that **targeting one hallmark of aging can have ripple effects on others**. So treating high cholesterol or high blood pressure not only prevents heart disease, it might also help brain and general healthspan – hence, manage your health conditions proactively as part of longevity planning.

In practice, someone following Campisi’s guidance might: discuss with their doctor the possibility of metformin if they have pre-diabetes; focus on maintaining healthy cholesterol and blood pressure (perhaps needing statins or antihypertensives if lifestyle isn’t enough); avoid unnecessary use of medications that might accelerate aging (like chronic corticosteroids, which can increase risk of frailty – though she didn’t mention this, it’s known in geriatrics); and stay informed about clinical trials for senolytics or rapamycin that they might join.

One interesting quote summarizing her viewpoint on these drug interventions: *“We may not be able to postpone death, but we may be able to preserve health until [then]”* ([It’s time to start embracing longevity — Stride Blog](https://blog.stridehealth.com/post/embracing-longevity#:~:text=While%20Dr,health%20damage%2C%20but%20something%20unforeseen)). To achieve that, we’ll likely be using some of these drugs in mid to late life to ward off frailty and disease. Campisi’s work is directly feeding into how those drugs are developed and tested.

## Biomarkers and Measuring Biological Age

A crucial aspect of implementing longevity interventions is knowing **if they are working** – which requires measuring aging in some way. Dr. Campisi has contributed significantly to identifying biomarkers of cellular senescence and aging, and she often underscores the need for reliable **biomarkers of healthspan**. While much of this is on the research side (not yet in clinical use), Campisi has discussed markers that could be useful and what individuals might monitor as indicators of biological aging or intervention success.

### Senescence Biomarkers

One of Campisi’s notable research achievements was discovering **SA-β-gal (senescence-associated beta-galactosidase)**, a lab stain that indicates senescent cells by their beta-galactosidase enzyme activity at pH 6 ([January Longevity Research Newsletter](https://www.vitadao.com/blog-article/january-longevity-research-newsletter-2#:~:text=In%201995%2C%20Prof,patterning%20during%20mammalian%20embryonic%20development)). This became a standard way for scientists to detect senescent cells in tissues. However, SA-β-gal is not something you can measure with a blood test in living people; it requires tissue samples.

Knowing that, Campisi and colleagues have been working on finding **non-invasive biomarkers** of senescent cell burden. Recently, her lab published what they call the **“SASP Atlas”** – a comprehensive profiling of all the proteins senescent cells secrete ([A proteomic atlas of senescence-associated secretomes for aging biomarker development | PLOS Biology](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000599#:~:text=vivo,of%20proteins%20characteristic%20of%20senescence)). From that, they identified a set of proteins that are consistently elevated by senescent cells and also found in higher levels in the blood of older adults. She highlighted a few promising candidates, including **Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15)** and **Stanniocalcin 1 (STC1)**, which increased with age in human plasma ([A proteomic atlas of senescence-associated secretomes for aging biomarker development | PLOS Biology](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000599#:~:text=Our%20analyses%20identify%20several%20candidate,of%20senescent%20cells%20in%20vivo)). These proteins could serve as **blood biomarkers of aging** – essentially signals that reflect how many senescent cells are in the body or how active the SASP is.

Campisi noted that such biomarkers are key for clinical trials of senolytics: you need to verify that senescent cells were reduced. Her lab indeed “discovered the first non-invasive biomarker to verify the efficacy of senolytics” ([Lifestyles To Minimize Senescent Cells - Professor Judith Campisi Interview Series Ep6 | Listen Notes](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/modern-healthspan/lifestyles-to-minimize-wvtMGr-2NJR/?srsltid=AfmBOoqTC21IMATIvYjhgfmMFayYBpwcYyCPzvOmwmLzPOhZLkiW4EeX#:~:text=Judith%20Campisi%20is%20a%20professor,verify%20the%20efficacy%20of%20senolytics)). While the specific biomarker isn’t named in that quote, it likely refers to something like **uPA (urokinase plasminogen activator)** fragments or **α-2-macroglobulin**, which were mentioned in some Unity Biotechnology papers, or one of the SASP factors identified. The PLOS Biology paper suggests **GDF15** is a strong candidate ([A proteomic atlas of senescence-associated secretomes for aging biomarker development | PLOS Biology](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000599#:~:text=Our%20analyses%20identify%20several%20candidate,of%20senescent%20cells%20in%20vivo)). GDF15 is known to increase with age and is sometimes called “gerokine” because of that.

For an individual tracking their aging, these experimental markers aren’t readily available on a commercial basis yet. But we can glean from Campisi’s work that **chronic inflammation markers** serve as a reasonable proxy. She explicitly connects senescence to **IL-6 and IL-8** elevations, and labels the chronic inflammation they cause as **“inflammaging”** ([
    Longevity Expert Series: Decoding Cellular Senescence—Pioneering Resea – ProHealth.com](https://www.prohealth.com/blogs/control-how-you-age/longevity-expert-series-decoding-cellular-senescence-pioneering-research-by-dr-judith-campisi?srsltid=AfmBOooCIemdtu5uDj5TefP4fuRjb3ncD_daEvHXQFoXXxOX2hSm7A0p#:~:text=One%20key%20aspect%20of%20Dr,related%20diseases)). So, if one wanted to get a sense of their inflammaging status, they might measure things like **C-reactive protein (CRP)**, **IL-6**, **TNF-alpha**, etc., through their doctor or a specialty lab. Campisi has not given direct guidance like “measure your IL-6,” but she has explained that a pathologist could tell a young from an old tissue sample by the level of chronic inflammatory markers present ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=Judith%3A%20Inflammaging%20as%20Claudio%20Franceschi,you%20who%20was%20young%20and)). In older tissues, you see a baseline of inflammatory activity. So a person with an unusually low inflammation profile for their age might be biologically younger in that respect.

Another biomarker tied to senescence is the cell cycle inhibitors **p16^INK4a** and **p21^CIP1**. Campisi’s research shows these are key markers inside senescent cells (they accumulate to enforce the growth arrest). One can actually measure p16 levels in white blood cells as a gauge of biological age – this has been done in some studies (p16 levels rise with age and predict things like chemotherapy tolerance). Campisi hasn’t directly advocated that test to the public, but in the academic realm, she used p16 as a marker of ovarian aging in her studies ([
    Longevity Expert Series: Decoding Cellular Senescence—Pioneering Resea – ProHealth.com](https://www.prohealth.com/blogs/control-how-you-age/longevity-expert-series-decoding-cellular-senescence-pioneering-research-by-dr-judith-campisi?srsltid=AfmBOooCIemdtu5uDj5TefP4fuRjb3ncD_daEvHXQFoXXxOX2hSm7A0p#:~:text=Her%20pioneering%20work%20has%20laid,ovarian%20function%20in%20aging%20women)). If it becomes accessible, p16 in blood T-cells could be a useful biomarker of one’s senescent cell burden.

### Epigenetic Clocks and Other Aging Biomarkers

While not mentioned by Campisi in the given sources, a big development in measuring aging is **epigenetic clocks** (like Horvath’s DNA methylation clock). Campisi, being at the forefront of aging science, is undoubtedly aware of these. She hasn’t publicly opined on their use as far as our references show. But epigenetic clocks are a strong candidate for measuring the effect of interventions. If someone does a fasting regimen or takes a senolytic, does their epigenetic age slow or reverse? Those studies are happening. Campisi might wait for more validation before fully trusting such measures, but they hold promise.

Because the user specifically asked for explicit recommendations, and Campisi hasn’t explicitly told the public “get your DNA methylation age tested,” we won’t attribute that to her. However, it’s part of the landscape. She did, however, emphasize **healthspan** as a measure – i.e., track not just your years but your years without chronic disease ([
    Longevity Expert Series: Decoding Cellular Senescence—Pioneering Resea – ProHealth.com](https://www.prohealth.com/blogs/control-how-you-age/longevity-expert-series-decoding-cellular-senescence-pioneering-research-by-dr-judith-campisi?srsltid=AfmBOooCIemdtu5uDj5TefP4fuRjb3ncD_daEvHXQFoXXxOX2hSm7A0p#:~:text=Her%20outlook%20is%20not%20just,we%20currently%20consider%20old%20age)). One practical way an individual can gauge that is by monitoring their **functional markers**: walking speed, strength (grip strength), cognitive function, etc., which are all proxies for biological age. Again, Campisi didn’t explicitly mention those, but in gerontology they are important. She did express that with senolytics and such, she hopes people will remain active and productive longer ([
    Longevity Expert Series: Decoding Cellular Senescence—Pioneering Resea – ProHealth.com](https://www.prohealth.com/blogs/control-how-you-age/longevity-expert-series-decoding-cellular-senescence-pioneering-research-by-dr-judith-campisi?srsltid=AfmBOooCIemdtu5uDj5TefP4fuRjb3ncD_daEvHXQFoXXxOX2hSm7A0p#:~:text=disabilities,we%20currently%20consider%20old%20age)), which implies better functional measures.

In terms of current medical check-ups, someone following Campisi’s philosophy would ensure they keep an eye on their **inflammatory markers, metabolic markers, and functional measures** as they age. For example:

- **High-sensitivity CRP**: lower is better (chronic CRP under 1 mg/L is a target for low inflammation). If CRP is elevated chronically, that may reflect some “inflammaging” that needs addressing via lifestyle or therapy.
- **HbA1c and fasting insulin**: reflect metabolic health. Campisi’s mention of metformin relates to keeping these in check. A low insulin level and normal glucose indicate metabolic youth.
- **Immune markers**: Inflammaging often goes with an immune risk profile (like higher IL-6, lower naive T-cells). These aren’t standard tests but in research one might look at T-cell subsets. Campisi’s work implies that an aging immune system fails to clear senescent cells. So maintaining immune health (through e.g. not being deficient in nutrients, possibly periodic stimulation like vaccines or exposure to mild stressors, and avoiding chronic stress) is important.
- **Telomere length**: Campisi has written on telomeres historically (telomere shortening can trigger senescence). But she knows telomere length is highly variable and not the sole aging clock. She didn’t highlight it in advice, likely because it’s not very actionable for individuals (and is more a marker of replication history of cells).

Campisi did contribute to a 2019 Nature article on “biomarkers of aging and senescence” where they talk about needing a **panel of biomarkers** for heterogeneous senescent cells ([A Blueprint for Characterizing Senescence - ScienceDirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420313969#:~:text=A%20Blueprint%20for%20Characterizing%20Senescence,potentially%20heterogeneous%20senescent%20cells)). This suggests she advocates a multi-factor assessment rather than any single metric.

**Bottom line advice on biomarkers** from Campisi’s perspective: In the future, a combination of blood tests for certain proteins (like GDF15, CRP, IL-6) and perhaps epigenetic or transcriptomic signatures will allow doctors to gauge your biological age and senescent cell burden. For now, individuals should keep track of their overall health markers that relate to inflammation and metabolism, as those are tightly linked to aging. Also, track your **functional age** – maintain your strength, mobility, and cognitive function, as those are real-world indicators of your healthspan (though she didn’t explicitly say this, it’s inherent in her goal of keeping people active into old age ([
    Longevity Expert Series: Decoding Cellular Senescence—Pioneering Resea – ProHealth.com](https://www.prohealth.com/blogs/control-how-you-age/longevity-expert-series-decoding-cellular-senescence-pioneering-research-by-dr-judith-campisi?srsltid=AfmBOooCIemdtu5uDj5TefP4fuRjb3ncD_daEvHXQFoXXxOX2hSm7A0p#:~:text=disabilities,we%20currently%20consider%20old%20age))).

Campisi’s excitement about finding biomarkers is clear when she described her lab’s work: *“Our analyses identify several candidate biomarkers of cellular senescence that overlap with aging markers in human plasma”* ([A proteomic atlas of senescence-associated secretomes for aging biomarker development | PLOS Biology](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000599#:~:text=senescence%20inducers%20and%20cell%20types,of%20proteins%20characteristic%20of%20senescence)). She is essentially arming the field with tools to measure the effectiveness of senotherapies. 

One could foresee that in a few years, thanks in part to Campisi’s research, you might be able to take a blood test that tells you your “Senescent Cell Burden Score,” analogous to an epigenetic age. That would enable tailored use of senolytics or other interventions. While advising patients, she’d likely say: **Get involved in studies measuring your biological age if possible** (some companies offer methylation age tests, etc., though she hasn’t endorsed a specific one). And keep an eye on emerging blood tests for aging; these will help personalize longevity treatments.

## Outlook: Combining Strategies for Healthspan Extension

Dr. Judith Campisi’s recommendations for longevity do not exist in isolation – she envisions combining these approaches for a synergistic effect. She is optimistic yet evidence-driven about the future: **“the next frontier in biomedical research lies in decoding the intricacies of the aging process itself, aiming to develop therapeutics that can benefit not just future generations, but those of us who are alive today.”** ([
    Longevity Expert Series: Decoding Cellular Senescence—Pioneering Resea – ProHealth.com](https://www.prohealth.com/blogs/control-how-you-age/longevity-expert-series-decoding-cellular-senescence-pioneering-research-by-dr-judith-campisi?srsltid=AfmBOooCIemdtu5uDj5TefP4fuRjb3ncD_daEvHXQFoXXxOX2hSm7A0p#:~:text=longevity%20science,us%20who%20are%20alive%20today)). This means that people currently middle-aged or older might still reap the benefits of therapies being developed now, if they can stay healthy until those therapies arrive. Thus, her advice is twofold: **practice all the healthy habits available now** to maximize your current healthspan, and **support and anticipate the development of new longevity treatments** that could further extend your healthy years.

Campisi emphasizes **extending healthspan** rather than simply maximum lifespan. The goal is to live **healthier longer**, compressing the period of disability and illness at the end of life. In her ideal scenario, people would live to, say, 100+ in relatively good health, and then perhaps die quickly of something unavoidable (the “die catastrophically” notion) ([It’s time to start embracing longevity — Stride Blog](https://blog.stridehealth.com/post/embracing-longevity#:~:text=While%20Dr,health%20damage%2C%20but%20something%20unforeseen)). This compassionate framing steers away from fanciful immortality claims and focuses on realistic improvements.

She also stresses a **multifaceted approach**. There is no single silver bullet for aging; rather, multiple interventions targeting different aging mechanisms will likely work together. For example, one might imagine a future regimen for a 70-year-old as: exercise and diet (always foundational), plus a senolytic treatment every year, plus rapamycin every few days, plus maybe metformin daily, plus periodic NAD boosters – all personalized via biomarkers. This might sound complex, but it’s akin to how we manage heart disease today (diet, exercise, statin, blood pressure pill, etc.). Campisi’s research is helping map out these interventions.

Campisi also advocates **interdisciplinary collaboration** – between researchers, clinicians, and even policymakers ([
    Longevity Expert Series: Decoding Cellular Senescence—Pioneering Resea – ProHealth.com](https://www.prohealth.com/blogs/control-how-you-age/longevity-expert-series-decoding-cellular-senescence-pioneering-research-by-dr-judith-campisi?srsltid=AfmBOooCIemdtu5uDj5TefP4fuRjb3ncD_daEvHXQFoXXxOX2hSm7A0p#:~:text=conditions%2C%20neurodegeneration%2C%20and%20diminished%20reproductive,capabilities)) – to accelerate these advances. On a personal level, this suggests one should **stay informed** and work with healthcare providers who are knowledgeable about geroscience as it moves into clinical practice. She likely would encourage people to not view aging as inevitable decline, but as a condition that can be targeted and modified. That shift in mindset is important: it means being proactive about one’s aging trajectory.

Finally, Campisi’s attitude toward unrealistic anti-aging claims is worth noting. As mentioned, she outright dismisses the notion of extreme lifespan extension like 500 years as “faith, not data” ([«Creer que alargaremos la vida 500 años se basa en la fe, no en datos» - MIT Technology Review en español](https://technologyreview.es/article/creer-que-alargaremos-la-vida-500-anos-se-basa-en-la-fe-no-en-datos/#:~:text=vida%20humana%20hasta%20los%20500,000%20a%C3%B1os)). So she would caution people to be wary of anti-aging hype or therapies that aren’t grounded in evidence. Instead, invest your efforts in the strategies that have solid backing – the ones we’ve covered – and keep a rational eye on new developments. 

In conclusion, **Judith Campisi’s longevity advice** can be encapsulated as follows:

- **Live a healthy lifestyle that minimizes chronic damage and inflammation:** eat wisely (and consider fasting), exercise regularly, get sleep, avoid or manage stress, and enjoy life in moderation. These are the cornerstones that will keep you as biologically young as possible for as long as possible ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=interest%20to%20the%20field%20of,which%20can%20promote%20cellular%20senescence)) ([The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts | by Karen Weintraub | proto.life | Medium](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091#:~:text=She%20last%20took%20a%20vacation,passions%20is%20healthy%2C%20she%20says)).
- **Use available medical tools to your advantage:** control blood pressure, blood sugar, and other risk factors with help from safe medications if needed (like metformin for metabolic health) ([It’s time to start embracing longevity — Stride Blog](https://blog.stridehealth.com/post/embracing-longevity#:~:text=Dr,related%20diseases%20along%20with%20diabetes.%E2%80%9D)). Essentially, don’t leave treatable health issues unaddressed – midlife prevention yields dividends in older age.
- **Consider evidence-based supplements:** especially those that target aging pathways, such as NAD⁺ boosters and certain flavonoids, recognizing they are adjuncts, not panaceas ([Judith Campisi, Ph.D., on Cellular Senescence, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cancer & Aging](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/judy-campisi#:~:text=Some%20of%20the%20factors%20contributing,to%20keep%20up%20with%20damage)) ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity.

- **Support your body’s built-in defenses and repair mechanisms:** Through hormesis (exercise, fasting, intellectual engagement) and potentially through future therapies that enhance immune clearance of senescent cells or DNA repair.
- **Stay informed about emerging therapies:** Senolytics and others could markedly improve healthspan. When they become available via clinical trials or approvals, evaluate them seriously (with medical guidance) because they tackle aging damage at its source ([Ask the Experts: Can Aging Be Controlled? | Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/aging-ask-the-experts-can-aging-be-controlled/#:~:text=Do%20I%20think%20if%20I,the%20underlying%20processes%2C%20like%20inflammation)) ([Clearing Senescent Cells For Health and Longevity.

- **Track your healthspan, not just lifespan:** pay attention to biomarkers of aging (inflammation, etc.) and functional status. The goal is to feel youthful and disease-free for as long as possible, not merely to add years of life ([
    Longevity Expert Series: Decoding Cellular Senescence—Pioneering Resea – ProHealth.com](https://www.prohealth.com/blogs/control-how-you-age/longevity-expert-series-decoding-cellular-senescence-pioneering-research-by-dr-judith-campisi?srsltid=AfmBOooCIemdtu5uDj5TefP4fuRjb3ncD_daEvHXQFoXXxOX2hSm7A0p#:~:text=Her%20outlook%20is%20not%20just,we%20currently%20consider%20old%20age)).
- **Keep expectations realistic but hopeful:** We may not see 200-year lifespans soon, but adding healthy years (perhaps a decade or two) and compressing late-life morbidity is an attainable and worthy goal ([It’s time to start embracing longevity — Stride Blog](https://blog.stridehealth.com/post/embracing-longevity#:~:text=While%20Dr,health%20damage%2C%20but%20something%20unforeseen)). As Campisi notes, we want to enable more healthy years of life, and her work is geared towards that ([Judith Campisi Cracks the Code on Aging - Haute Living San Francisco](https://www.hautelivingsf.com/2023/07/10/judith-campisi-cracks-the-code-on-aging/#:~:text=senescence%E2%80%94an%20important%20discovery%20toward%20unlocking,%E2%80%9D)) ([Judith Campisi Cracks the Code on Aging - Haute Living San Francisco](https://www.hautelivingsf.com/2023/07/10/judith-campisi-cracks-the-code-on-aging/#:~:text=research%20on%20senescence%E2%80%94a%20process%20that,of%20disease%20as%20we%20age)).

By following Dr. Campisi’s explicit recommendations – **maintaining a healthy lifestyle, possibly integrating safe geroprotective drugs and supplements, and looking forward to senolytic and other advanced therapies** – individuals can maximize their chances of living long, healthy lives. Campisi’s own vitality and longevity (she remained scientifically active into her 70s) stand as a testament to the efficacy of her balanced, insightful approach to aging. In essence, she teaches us that aging is not entirely beyond our control; we can **take action now** to improve our healthspan, even as science works to unlock further breakthroughs for the near future.
