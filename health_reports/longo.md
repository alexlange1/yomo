# Dr. Valter Longo: Longevity, Diet, Fasting, and Health

**Valter D. Longo, Ph.D.** is a biogerontologist internationally recognized for his research on aging, nutrition, and fasting. He directs the USC Longevity Institute and has pioneered dietary interventions like the Fasting-Mimicking Diet to promote healthy lifespan. In 2018, *Time* magazine named Longo one of the world’s top 50 most influential people in healthcare for his contributions to longevity science ([The opportunity for everyone of a long and healthy life - Fondazione Valter Longo](https://www.fondazionevalterlongo.org/en/#:~:text=Valter%20Longo%20is%20Professor%20of,of%20the%20most%20serious%20diseases)). Below is a comprehensive overview of Dr. Longo’s beliefs, findings, and recommendations, organized by topic, with supporting quotes and sources.

## Fasting and the Fasting-Mimicking Diet (FMD)

Dr. Longo is perhaps best known for developing the **Fasting-Mimicking Diet (FMD)** – a 5-day plant-based meal program that provides minimal calories (high in unsaturated fats, very low in proteins and sugars) to simulate the effects of a water-only fast while still supplying essential nutrients ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=The%20study%2C%20which%20appears%20in,author%20of%20the%20new%20study)) ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=fasting,The%20diet%20was%20developed%20by)). The FMD was created to be a safer, more practical alternative to prolonged fasting, which can be difficult to adhere to and potentially risky without medical supervision ([Episode #6 Intermittent Fasting with Dr. Valter Longo: Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine](https://awcim.arizona.edu/podcast/episode06_Longo.html#:~:text=Longo%3A%20Yes%2C%20its%20a%20difficulty%2C,Even%20if%20they%20have%20a)) ([Episode #6 Intermittent Fasting with Dr. Valter Longo: Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine](https://awcim.arizona.edu/podcast/episode06_Longo.html#:~:text=from%20that%2C%20that%20would%20maintain,only%20be%20done%20in%20a)). In clinical trials, participants on the FMD eat the specially formulated low-calorie meals for five days, then return to a normal diet for the rest of the month ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=The%20study%20analyzed%20the%20diet%E2%80%99s,style%20diet)) ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=randomized%20to%20the%20fasting,style%20diet)). This intermittent approach aims to reap fasting’s benefits periodically, without chronic daily restriction.

**Research Findings:** Longo’s laboratory and collaborators have shown remarkable effects of FMD cycles in both animals and humans. In mice, a 4-day FMD caused many organs to shrink and then rebuild upon re-feeding, triggering stem cell production and regeneration ([

Bi-monthly FMD cycles in middle-aged mice extended their lifespan, reduced visceral fat and cancer incidence, rejuvenated the immune system, and even improved cognitive performance in older mice (by inducing hippocampal neurogenesis and lowering IGF-1 and PKA signaling) ([

In a pilot human trial, just three monthly FMD cycles led to reductions in biomarkers for aging, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, **with no major adverse effects** ([

These early human results supported the idea that periodic fasting can promote “healthspan” – the healthy, disease-free years of life ([

        ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4509734/#:~:text=elevated%20NeuroD1%2C%20and%20improved%20cognitive,of%20FMDs%20to%20promote%20healthspan)).

> “I always say that fasting doesn’t really mean anything. Fasting is like saying eating… it can be very good or very bad, depending on what you do, how long you do it for, who you are, etc. So… be careful, because fasting-based intervention can be very powerful or very damaging.” ([Professor Valter Longo: fasting and healthy aging - Center for Lifespan Health](https://lifespanhealth.usc.edu/professor-valter-longo-fasting-and-healthy-aging/#:~:text=carefully%3A)) 

Longo often emphasizes that **context and caution are critical** with fasting. As the quote above shows, he warns against one-size-fits-all use of “fasting” – the details (duration, method, individual health status) determine whether it’s beneficial or harmful ([Professor Valter Longo: fasting and healthy aging - Center for Lifespan Health](https://lifespanhealth.usc.edu/professor-valter-longo-fasting-and-healthy-aging/#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)). This mindset led to the development of the FMD: to harness fasting’s upsides (cellular stress resistance, autophagy, etc.) in a controlled way that is safer and easier for people to stick with ([Episode #6 Intermittent Fasting with Dr. Valter Longo: Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine](https://awcim.arizona.edu/podcast/episode06_Longo.html#:~:text=Longo%3A%20Yes%2C%20its%20a%20difficulty%2C,Even%20if%20they%20have%20a)) ([Episode #6 Intermittent Fasting with Dr. Valter Longo: Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine](https://awcim.arizona.edu/podcast/episode06_Longo.html#:~:text=trials%20on%2C%20on%20cancer%20here,Even%20if%20they%20have%20a)). In fact, Longo’s team found that many people (especially cancer patients) struggled to do even short water-only fasts, motivating the search for a “fasting mimicking” diet that people *could* maintain periodically ([Episode #6 Intermittent Fasting with Dr. Valter Longo: Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine](https://awcim.arizona.edu/podcast/episode06_Longo.html#:~:text=Longo%3A%20Yes%2C%20its%20a%20difficulty%2C,Even%20if%20they%20have%20a)) ([Episode #6 Intermittent Fasting with Dr. Valter Longo: Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine](https://awcim.arizona.edu/podcast/episode06_Longo.html#:~:text=trials%20on%2C%20on%20cancer%20here,Even%20if%20they%20have%20a)).

**Human Trials:** In recent clinical studies, periodic FMD cycles have yielded promising outcomes. A 2024 randomized trial reported that 3–4 cycles of the 5-day FMD (one cycle per month) significantly *lowered key disease risk factors*: participants saw reductions in insulin resistance and fasting glucose, drops in abdominal and liver fat, and improved cholesterol and blood pressure profiles ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=An%20analysis%20of%20blood%20samples,a%20more%20youthful%20immune%20system)) ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=Further%20statistical%20analysis%20of%20the,5%20years%20on%20average)). Notably, immune system markers shifted toward a more “youthful” profile (an increased lymphocyte-to-neutrophil ratio) after FMD, suggesting a rejuvenating effect on immune cell populations ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=An%20analysis%20of%20blood%20samples,a%20more%20youthful%20immune%20system)) ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=abdominal%20fat%20as%20well%20as,a%20more%20youthful%20immune%20system)). Perhaps most striking, the study found that FMD participants had reduced their **biological age** (as measured by epigenetic/biomarker clocks) by an average of about **2.5 years** compared to controls ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=Further%20statistical%20analysis%20of%20the,5%20years%20on%20average)). Dr. Longo stated: *“This is the first study to show that a food-based intervention that does not require chronic [changes] can make people biologically younger, based on… risk factors for aging and disease”* ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=Further%20statistical%20analysis%20of%20the,5%20years%20on%20average)).

Longo’s prior studies provide context for these results. His lab had earlier demonstrated that even **one or two FMD cycles per month** can extend healthy lifespan in mice and reduce risk factors for age-related diseases in humans ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=associated%20with%20a%20range%20of,system%20aging%20in%20humans%20were)) ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=of%C2%A0chemotherapy%20side%20effects%2C%20and%20reduction,humans%20were%20unknown%20until%20now)). Other research led by Longo showed FMD cycles promote **stem cell-based regeneration** of immune cells ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=Previous%20research%20led%20by%20Longo,diabetes%2C%20heart%20disease%20and%20other)) and mitigate chemotherapy side effects in cancer patients ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=Previous%20research%20led%20by%20Longo,122%20lowering%20of%20the%20risk)). In animal models, FMDs have lessened signs of cognitive decline (e.g. Alzheimer-like pathology) ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=Previous%20research%20led%20by%20Longo,122%20lowering%20of%20the%20risk)) and even reversed symptoms in multiple sclerosis models (more on that under *Disease Treatment* below). These multifaceted benefits – metabolic, immune, and regenerative – suggest that periodic fasting can “reset” or rejuvenate the body in ways that standard diets do not.

**Recommendations:** Based on his findings, Dr. Longo often recommends **undergoing the FMD a few times per year** for those who are good candidates. For generally healthy individuals (especially those with some elevated disease risk factors), he suggests a 5-day FMD **about 2 to 4 times annually** as a preventative measure ([Food for Thought: Eating for Longevity — AMEVIDA](https://www.liveamevida.com/blog/eating-for-longevity#:~:text=fasting%20period%20%28e,follow%20the%20standard%20American%20diet)). Each cycle should ideally include a **12-hour fasting window each day** (for example, eating only between 8am and 8pm during the FMD) ([Food for Thought: Eating for Longevity — AMEVIDA](https://www.liveamevida.com/blog/eating-for-longevity#:~:text=Try%20the%20Fasting,follow%20the%20standard%20American%20diet)). Longo notes that some individuals extend the daily fast to 14 hours, but he usually cautions not to greatly exceed ~12 hours daily fasting for long-term routine (see **Longevity Diet** section for why). The FMD is particularly advised by Longo for people who otherwise follow a typical Western diet and may need a “metabolic reset” a few times a year ([Food for Thought: Eating for Longevity — AMEVIDA](https://www.liveamevida.com/blog/eating-for-longevity#:~:text=fasting%20period%20%28e,follow%20the%20standard%20American%20diet)). However, **fasting interventions should be done under medical guidance**, especially for those with existing health conditions – a point Longo reiterates often ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=Longo%20said%20the%20findings%20beg,diet%E2%80%99s%20effect%20on%20autoimmune%20disorders)) ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=the%20diet,%E2%80%9D)).

For practical accessibility, Longo founded a company that produces a commercially available FMD program called **ProLon**, which provides pre-packaged 5-day meal kits that adhere to the nutrient profile used in his research ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=)). (He has no direct profit from ProLon; proceeds are partially used to fund his nonprofit research and patient support foundations ([Philanthropy

Many physicians in the U.S. and Europe now integrate FMD cycles into patient care, and Longo expects wider adoption as evidence mounts ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=extensive%20lifestyle%20changes%2C%20Longo%20said)) ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAlthough%20many%20doctors%20are%20already,and%20younger%20age%2C%E2%80%9D%20Longo%20said)). *“These findings should encourage many more healthcare professionals to recommend FMD cycles to patients with higher-than-desired levels of disease risk factors as well as to the general population interested in increased function and younger age,”* Longo says of the newest results ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=extensive%20lifestyle%20changes%2C%20Longo%20said)) ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAlthough%20many%20doctors%20are%20already,and%20younger%20age%2C%E2%80%9D%20Longo%20said)).

## The Longevity Diet (Everyday Nutrition for Lifespan)

While periodic fasting is one “tool” for longevity, Dr. Longo’s broader advice centers on what he calls the **“Longevity Diet,”** an everyday eating pattern derived from both modern science and the time-tested traditions of long-lived populations ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=Examining%20a%20range%20of%20nutrition,of%20Gerontology%20professor%20Valter%20Longo)) ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20explored%20the%20link%20between,%E2%80%9D)). In 2022, Longo and colleague Rozalyn Anderson published a comprehensive review in *Cell* assembling over a century of research – from laboratory studies in short-lived organisms to human epidemiological data and clinical trials – to define the optimal diet for longevity ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=Examining%20a%20range%20of%20nutrition,of%20Gerontology%20professor%20Valter%20Longo)) ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20explored%20the%20link%20between,%E2%80%9D)). They concluded that the best diet “for a longer, healthier life” is a **multi-pillar approach** that considers not just calorie count, but also nutrient composition and meal timing (including fasting periods) ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=In%20an%20article%20that%20includes,and%20frequency%20of%20fasting%20periods)) ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=%E2%80%9Clongevity%20diet%2C%E2%80%9D%20a%20multi,and%20frequency%20of%20fasting%20periods)).

**Key Characteristics:** The Longevity Diet can be summarized as follows (largely consistent with diets observed in certain “Blue Zones” of exceptional human longevity):

- **Predominantly Plant-Based:** Meals should be mostly plant-derived – **vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds** form the core ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=Longo%20described%20what%20a%20longevity,%E2%80%9D)) ([Food for Thought: Eating for Longevity — AMEVIDA](https://www.liveamevida.com/blog/eating-for-longevity#:~:text=Use%20Tactics%20from%20the%20Longevity,order%20to%20avoid%20excess%20sugars)). Animal protein is minimal; **no red or processed meat, and very little white meat (poultry)** ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=Longo%20described%20what%20a%20longevity,%E2%80%9D)). Small portions of animal products can come from low-mercury **fish or seafood a few times per week** (e.g. 2–4 times weekly) to provide additional protein and omega-3 fats ([Food for Thought: Eating for Longevity — AMEVIDA](https://www.liveamevida.com/blog/eating-for-longevity#:~:text=Use%20Tactics%20from%20the%20Longevity,order%20to%20avoid%20excess%20sugars)). Dairy is limited; if any, small amounts of fermented dairy or certain cheeses are preferred, but **minimal cheese** overall ([Food for Thought: Eating for Longevity — AMEVIDA](https://www.liveamevida.com/blog/eating-for-longevity#:~:text=diets%2C%20this%20largely%20vegan%20approach,is%20generally%20low%2C%20too%2C%20in)).

- **Low but Sufficient Protein:** Total protein intake is kept on the low side (around 0.7-0.8 g of protein per kg body weight per day), and it is **primarily plant protein** (from beans, chickpeas, lentils, nuts, etc.) rather than animal ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=The%20authors%20report%20that%20the,blood%20pressure%20and%20other%20risk)) ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=Longo%20described%20what%20a%20longevity,%E2%80%9D)). This is based on evidence that excessive protein – especially from animal sources – can elevate IGF-1 and accelerate aging and cancer risk, whereas moderate protein from plant sources is associated with longevity ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=The%20authors%20report%20that%20the,blood%20pressure%20and%20other%20risk)). Longo notes that high protein may be more detrimental in middle age, whereas seniors above ~65 may reintroduce more protein to prevent frailty ([[Valter Longo]-The Longevity Diet- Discover The New Science ...](https://www.amazon.com/Longevity-Discover-Activation-Regeneration-Optimize/dp/B07VMFTF63#:~:text=,Applying%20these%20pillars%20in)). But for most adults, **“low but sufficient” protein is ideal**, and **legumes** are a staple protein source in long-lived societies ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=What%20changes%20would%20you%20like,see%20in%20people%E2%80%99s%20everyday%20diets)) ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=grains%2C%20are%20very%20good%20for,run%20this%20leads%20to%20problems)).

- **High Complex Carbohydrates:** Contrary to trendy low-carb diets, Longo advocates for **carbohydrates from unrefined, high-fiber sources** – which should make up a large portion of calories ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=The%20authors%20report%20that%20the,individuals%20with%20increased%20disease%20risks)) ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=matter%20of%20oversimplification%2C%20in%20which,long%20run%20this%20leads%20to)). Vegetables and whole grains (like brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat, oats, etc.) provide these complex carbs. He points out that *“all the populations who have record longevity have a high-carbohydrate diet. All of them. No exceptions.”* ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=associated%20with%20a%20lot%20of,run%20this%20leads%20to%20problems)) ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=grains%2C%20are%20very%20good%20for,run%20this%20leads%20to%20problems)) This refers to traditional diets in places like Okinawa or Sardinia, which are heavy in plant starches (sweet potatoes, corn, wheat, etc.) but minimally processed. Refined sugars and refined grains, however, should be limited – **low sugar intake** is stressed (even fruit is consumed in low-moderate quantities to avoid excessive fructose) ([Food for Thought: Eating for Longevity — AMEVIDA](https://www.liveamevida.com/blog/eating-for-longevity#:~:text=diets%2C%20this%20largely%20vegan%20approach,order%20to%20avoid%20excess%20sugars)) ([Food for Thought: Eating for Longevity — AMEVIDA](https://www.liveamevida.com/blog/eating-for-longevity#:~:text=four%20times%20a%20week,order%20to%20avoid%20excess%20sugars)).

- **Ample Plant-Based Fats:** Around **30% of daily calories from healthy fats** is recommended ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=The%20authors%20report%20that%20the,blood%20pressure%20and%20other%20risk)). The fats should predominantly come from plant sources like **extra-virgin olive oil, nuts, seeds, and avocado**. Longo highlights that **unsaturated fats** (e.g. olive oil, nuts, and even fatty fish like salmon) are linked to positive health effects, whereas **saturated and trans fats** are the ones to minimize ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=matter%20of%20oversimplification%2C%20in%20which,long%20run%20this%20leads%20to)) ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=Proteins%20are%20good%20and%20bad,run%20this%20leads%20to%20problems)). In practical terms, using olive oil generously (as in Mediterranean cuisine) and snacking on a handful of nuts can help meet caloric needs while supporting heart health. Trans fats (hydrogenated oils) are avoided entirely, and animal fats (butter, lard) are kept very low.

- **Moderate Eating Window:** **Time-restricted eating** is a component of the longevity diet. Longo advises **keeping daily eating to about a 12-hour window** and fasting for ~12 hours each day ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=What%20about%20the%20timing%20of,when%20we%20eat)). For example, if breakfast is at 8am, finish dinner by 8pm. This habit aligns with how centenarians traditionally ate (many did not snack late or eat around the clock) ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=It%20turns%20out%20that%20it,So%20not%20only%20is)) ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=associated%20with%20metabolic%20problems%2C%20sleep,it%20is%20bad%20for%20you)). Longo cites studies (including his own data) showing that eating for >15 hours a day is associated with metabolic and sleep problems, while fasting much beyond 13 hours can also be counterproductive for some, potentially increasing gallstone risk and leading to skipping breakfast ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=What%20about%20the%20timing%20of,when%20we%20eat)) ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=you%20fast%20for%20longer%20than,it%20is%20bad%20for%20you)). In fact, he cautions that **skipping breakfast regularly is linked to higher overall mortality and cardiovascular risk**, so he generally recommends eating breakfast and an early dinner, rather than a pattern of noon-to-night eating ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=associated%20with%20metabolic%20problems%2C%20sleep,it%20is%20bad%20for%20you)) ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=people%20to%20skip%20breakfast,it%20is%20bad%20for%20you)). Thus, ~12 hours feeding/12 fasting is a balanced approach for most. *(Individuals who are overweight may benefit from a slightly longer fasting window, e.g. 14 hours, but Longo’s standard advice is not to extend daily fasts too long, especially in normal or thin individuals ([Food for Thought: Eating for Longevity — AMEVIDA](https://www.liveamevida.com/blog/eating-for-longevity#:~:text=Try%20the%20Fasting,follow%20the%20standard%20American%20diet)) ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=It%20turns%20out%20that%20it,So%20not%20only%20is)).)*

- **Periodic Fasting Cycles:** In addition to healthy everyday meals, the longevity diet plan includes **periodic multi-day fasting** (or FMD) cycles a few times per year for additional benefit ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=moderate%20to%20high%20carbohydrate%20intake,individuals%20with%20increased%20disease%20risks)) ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=to%20provide%20about%2030%20percent,blood%20pressure%20and%20other%20risk)). As discussed, Longo suggests a 5-day FMD roughly once every **3–4 months** for people with normal health (and perhaps more frequently, e.g. every 2 months, for those at high risk for diabetes, cancer, or other conditions) ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=moderate%20to%20high%20carbohydrate%20intake,individuals%20with%20increased%20disease%20risks)) ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=to%20provide%20about%2030%20percent,individuals%20with%20increased%20disease%20risks)). This intermittent deep dive into fasting mode can further reduce visceral fat, blood pressure, IGF-1 and other risk factors beyond what the daily diet achieves ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=moderate%20to%20high%20carbohydrate%20intake,individuals%20with%20increased%20disease%20risks)) ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=to%20provide%20about%2030%20percent,individuals%20with%20increased%20disease%20risks)). In practice, these fasting cycles could be done with the ProLon kits or a medically supervised fasting diet.

- **Enjoyment and Moderation:** Longo is not overly prescriptive about minor treats – in fact, he explicitly says *“some dark chocolate”* is allowed on the longevity diet ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=Longo%20described%20what%20a%20longevity,%E2%80%9D)), and he permits **coffee and tea** (unsweetened) as well. Small amounts of alcohol are acceptable; *“coffee and alcohol in moderation are allowed — red wine is preferred,”* he notes, consistent with Mediterranean tradition ([[PDF] The-Longevity-Diet-TIMES-22-Longo-Jan-2018.pdf](https://gero.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/The-Longevity-Diet-TIMES-22-Longo-Jan-2018.pdf#:~:text=Longo%20is%20publishing%20a%20book,red%20wine%20is%20preferred)). This means an occasional glass of red wine with dinner can be part of the plan (though heavy drinking is certainly not condoned). Overall, the diet should be healthy **but also enjoyable and sustainable**; Longo has said he actually recommends people eat **more** of the right foods rather than simply eating less of everything ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=A%3A%20In%20the%20aging%20field%2C,a%20good%20amount%20of%20protein)) ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=your%20brain%20is%2C%20%E2%80%9CI%20can%E2%80%99t,amount%20and%20fills%20your%20stomach)). For example, by filling your plate with beans, veggies, and some whole grains dressed in olive oil, you can eat to satiety (“big portions” of nutrient-dense, lower-calorie foods) so that you don’t feel hungry, instead of trying to white-knuckle through constant calorie deprivation ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=A%3A%20In%20the%20aging%20field%2C,a%20good%20amount%20of%20protein)) ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=actually%20recommending%20eating%20more%2C%20with,the%20simple%20carbohydrates%20to%20a)). This approach mirrors how some traditional cultures eat large volumes of plant foods and feel full, yet remain slim and healthy.

**Real-World Examples:** In interviews, Longo often describes how this longevity diet reflects the cuisines of places like rural Italy, Okinawa, or Loma Linda (California), where many centenarians live. *“Lots of legumes, whole grains, and vegetables; some fish; no red meat or processed meat and very low white meat; low sugar and refined grains; good levels of nuts and olive oil, and some dark chocolate,”* is how he summarily describes it ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=Longo%20described%20what%20a%20longevity,%E2%80%9D)). In fact, he explains that in the past, Italians in longevity hotspots **did not consume large plates of pasta** as popular myth holds – instead, they ate plenty of garden vegetables and beans, with pasta as a smaller side dish. *“People are accustomed to eating a bowl of pasta or rice with a little bit of whatever on top; it should be the other way around – a ton of beans and vegetables and a little bit of pasta and maybe a sprinkle of cheese,”* Longo says. Once you make that switch, *“it actually tastes a lot better.”* ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=You%20are%20from%20Italy%2C%20which,do%20the%20two%20go%20together)) ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=The%20reality%20is%20that%20the,actually%20tastes%20a%20lot%20better)) 

By combining insights from basic science and the **“wisdom of centenarians,”** Longo’s longevity diet aims to maximize nourishment and minimize risk factors. It is **not** a fad or crash diet, but a set of principles: high nourishment, mostly plant-based, moderate energy intake, and periodic fasting. Longo is confident that adhering to this pattern can substantially reduce incidence of modern chronic diseases. As he bluntly stated in one Q&A: *“Other than genes, it is hard to think of something that can be more powerful than food in determining whether someone is going to make it to 100 or die before 50 years old.”* ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=How%20important%20is%20food%20to,our%20health%20and%20aging)) ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=Other%20than%20genes%2C%20it%20is,need%20for%20drugs%20and%20interventions)) In his view, type 2 diabetes and many cases of cardiovascular disease are largely *“inventions of a modern diet,”* whereas eating the right foods provides *“the least costly way to take care of a lot of problems”* and is *“key to a longer and healthier life.”* ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=How%20important%20is%20food%20to,our%20health%20and%20aging)) ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=Other%20than%20genes%2C%20it%20is,people%20are%20going%20to%20get))

## Longevity Principles and Aging Research

Central to Dr. Longo’s approach is a reliance on multiple pillars of evidence to guide recommendations. He often refers to the **“Five Pillars of Longevity”** – a framework he developed to evaluate any purported anti-aging strategy. The five pillars are: **(1) Basic/Juventology Research** (studies in model organisms and cells on aging mechanisms), **(2) Epidemiology** (population studies of diet and disease correlations), **(3) Clinical Studies** (controlled trials in humans), **(4) Centenarian Studies** (observations of long-lived people’s lifestyles), and **(5) Studies of Complex Systems** (systems biology and mathematical models) ([[Valter Longo]-The Longevity Diet- Discover The New Science ...](https://www.amazon.com/Longevity-Discover-Activation-Regeneration-Optimize/dp/B07VMFTF63#:~:text=,Applying%20these%20pillars%20in)). Longo’s recommendations, such as the longevity diet, sit at the intersection of all these pillars – meaning they are supported by lab biology, human demographics, clinical trials, and real-world observations of healthy agers ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=Examining%20a%20range%20of%20nutrition,of%20Gerontology%20professor%20Valter%20Longo)) ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20explored%20the%20link%20between,%E2%80%9D)). By applying this cross-disciplinary filter, he aims to avoid the pitfalls of focusing on just one type of evidence. For example, a fad diet might have short-term clinical trial results but no basis in evolutionary biology or conflicts with what we see in centenarians; such a diet would not pass Longo’s five-pillar test ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=Examining%20a%20range%20of%20nutrition,of%20Gerontology%20professor%20Valter%20Longo)) ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20explored%20the%20link%20between,%E2%80%9D)).

Longo’s overarching **goal** is not merely to extend lifespan, but to extend **“healthspan”** – keeping people healthier longer, so that one can approach the maximum human age (perhaps 110+ years) *in good health*. *“I want to optimize the chance for people to make it to 110 healthy. That’s it,”* he says. *“To make it to 110 healthy, you have to solve it all… if you get cancer or diabetes or Alzheimer’s, that’s not going to happen. So the focus is on healthy longevity for the sake of reaching that goal.”* ([Professor Valter Longo: fasting and healthy aging - Center for Lifespan Health](https://lifespanhealth.usc.edu/professor-valter-longo-fasting-and-healthy-aging/#:~:text=Longo%E2%80%99s%20ambitious%20goal%20for%20human,longevity)) ([Professor Valter Longo: fasting and healthy aging - Center for Lifespan Health](https://lifespanhealth.usc.edu/professor-valter-longo-fasting-and-healthy-aging/#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)) In practical terms, this means targeting the major diseases of aging *before* they arise, through diet and lifestyle. Longo believes we need to **“solve it all”** – i.e. prevent or delay the onset of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurodegeneration – in order to significantly push the boundaries of human longevity ([Professor Valter Longo: fasting and healthy aging - Center for Lifespan Health](https://lifespanhealth.usc.edu/professor-valter-longo-fasting-and-healthy-aging/#:~:text=Longo%E2%80%99s%20ambitious%20goal%20for%20human,longevity)) ([Professor Valter Longo: fasting and healthy aging - Center for Lifespan Health](https://lifespanhealth.usc.edu/professor-valter-longo-fasting-and-healthy-aging/#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)).

Another principle he highlights is the **reality of human behavior**: any intervention for longevity must be realistic for the majority of people. *“The reality is 90 percent of people are never going to change what they eat… They may make small changes, but they’re not going to make big changes in the long run,”* Longo observes ([Professor Valter Longo: fasting and healthy aging - Center for Lifespan Health](https://lifespanhealth.usc.edu/professor-valter-longo-fasting-and-healthy-aging/#:~:text=On%20accepting%20that%20most%20drastic,stick%20for%20the%20long%20term)) ([Professor Valter Longo: fasting and healthy aging - Center for Lifespan Health](https://lifespanhealth.usc.edu/professor-valter-longo-fasting-and-healthy-aging/#:~:text=,people%20should%20start%20dealing%20with)). Many diets fail because they demand radical, permanent changes that most cannot sustain. **This understanding informs Longo’s strategy**: instead of prescribing severe daily restrictions that people will abandon, he favors moderate, flexible changes (like switching to healthier food substitutes, or doing short fasting stints periodically). By working with human nature, his programs have a better chance of long-term success. Indeed, the development of the fasting-mimicking diet was in part to improve **compliance** – to give people an easier method to get fasting benefits without the misery that causes drop-out ([Episode #6 Intermittent Fasting with Dr. Valter Longo: Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine](https://awcim.arizona.edu/podcast/episode06_Longo.html#:~:text=Longo%3A%20Yes%2C%20its%20a%20difficulty%2C,Even%20if%20they%20have%20a)) ([Episode #6 Intermittent Fasting with Dr. Valter Longo: Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine](https://awcim.arizona.edu/podcast/episode06_Longo.html#:~:text=trials%20on%2C%20on%20cancer%20here,Even%20if%20they%20have%20a)).

Longo’s perspective on aging is also shaped by evolutionary logic. He notes that most organisms in nature go through frequent cycles of feast and famine; constant food abundance is abnormal and may shut off cellular maintenance programs ([Episode #6 Intermittent Fasting with Dr. Valter Longo: Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine](https://awcim.arizona.edu/podcast/episode06_Longo.html#:~:text=Dr,And)) ([Fasting-like diet turns the immune system against cancer](https://keck.usc.edu/news/fasting-like-diet-turns-the-immune-system-against-cancer/#:~:text=Natural%20mechanism%3F)). *“It may be that by always being exposed to so much food, we are no longer taking advantage of natural protective systems which allow the body to kill cancer cells,”* he speculated, adding that a fasting period can reactivate *“sophisticated mechanisms to identify and destroy the bad cells in a natural way.”* ([Fasting-like diet turns the immune system against cancer](https://keck.usc.edu/news/fasting-like-diet-turns-the-immune-system-against-cancer/#:~:text=Natural%20mechanism%3F)) ([Fasting-like diet turns the immune system against cancer](https://keck.usc.edu/news/fasting-like-diet-turns-the-immune-system-against-cancer/#:~:text=Longo%20said%20it%E2%80%99s%20unclear%20if,to%20protect%20us%20from%20disease)) In other words, our bodies likely evolved to benefit from intermittent stress (like hunger or exercise) followed by recovery. Modern lifestyles of constant eating and minimal physical exertion fail to trigger those ancient protective circuits. Longo’s interventions – fasting, plant-based diets, exercise – can be seen as ways to reintroduce biological “challenges” that tune up our system for longevity.

Finally, while his work focuses heavily on nutrition, Longo acknowledges the role of **genetics and other factors** in aging. He cites research on centenarians indicating that *genes* are a powerful determinant of reaching extreme old age (some people are blessed with gene variants that protect them even if their lifestyle isn’t perfect) ([A Lesson From Centenarians: Physical Activity](https://www.drfranklipman.com/post/a-lesson-from-centenarians-exercise#:~:text=very%20active%20into%20old%20age,diseases%20in%20both%20mice%20and)) ([A Lesson From Centenarians: Physical Activity](https://www.drfranklipman.com/post/a-lesson-from-centenarians-exercise#:~:text=genetics,affecting%20lifespan%20is%20physical%20activity)). For example, some centenarians in studies ate whatever they wanted and hardly exercised, yet lived to 100, likely due to genetic luck ([A Lesson From Centenarians: Physical Activity](https://www.drfranklipman.com/post/a-lesson-from-centenarians-exercise#:~:text=very%20active%20into%20old%20age,diseases%20in%20both%20mice%20and)) ([A Lesson From Centenarians: Physical Activity](https://www.drfranklipman.com/post/a-lesson-from-centenarians-exercise#:~:text=Medicine%20studies%20Ashkenazi%20Jewish%20centenarians,But%20after%20making%20changes)). *“Clearly genes are the most powerful factor in determining lifespan,”* Longo notes – as seen in both humans and animals (a chimpanzee can eat ideally and exercise and still won’t reach human lifespans due to genetic limits) ([A Lesson From Centenarians: Physical Activity](https://www.drfranklipman.com/post/a-lesson-from-centenarians-exercise#:~:text=Medicine%20studies%20Ashkenazi%20Jewish%20centenarians,But%20after%20making%20changes)) ([A Lesson From Centenarians: Physical Activity](https://www.drfranklipman.com/post/a-lesson-from-centenarians-exercise#:~:text=regularly%20yet%20never%20come%20close,affecting%20lifespan%20is%20physical%20activity)). However, **genes are not modifiable**, so his work concentrates on the *next-best levers*: diet and lifestyle. *“There is nothing we can do about our genes. But after making changes in the diet, the second major factor affecting lifespan is physical activity,”* Longo writes ([A Lesson From Centenarians: Physical Activity](https://www.drfranklipman.com/post/a-lesson-from-centenarians-exercise#:~:text=cause%20a%20high%20degree%20of,affecting%20lifespan%20is%20physical%20activity)) ([A Lesson From Centenarians: Physical Activity](https://www.drfranklipman.com/post/a-lesson-from-centenarians-exercise#:~:text=age%20fifty,affecting%20lifespan%20is%20physical%20activity)). In sum, we should control what we can (nutrition, fasting, exercise, etc.) to overcome what we inherited. Even those without “longevity genes” might reach 90+ in good shape by rigorously applying healthy lifestyle principles – which is precisely what the Longevity Diet and FMD are designed to help achieve.

## Disease Prevention and Treatment

A driving motivation behind Longo’s research is to **prevent or combat chronic diseases of aging** through fasting and diet. He often states that many deadly illnesses – cancer, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer’s – are to a large extent food- and age-related, and thus might be delayed or even avoided by optimal nutrition ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=Other%20than%20genes%2C%20it%20is,people%20are%20going%20to%20get)) ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=before%2050%20years%20old,need%20for%20drugs%20and%20interventions)). Over the years, Longo’s studies have explored how fasting or FMD impacts specific conditions:

- **Metabolic Diseases (Diabetes, Obesity):** Fasting interventions show great promise in improving metabolic health. In clinical trials, periodic FMD cycles lowered blood glucose, insulin, and HbA1c (a marker of long-term blood sugar) in participants, indicating improved insulin sensitivity ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=An%20analysis%20of%20blood%20samples,a%20more%20youthful%20immune%20system)) ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=An%20analysis%20of%20blood%20samples,a%20more%20youthful%20immune%20system)). Participants also lost visceral fat and reduced fatty infiltration in the liver ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=An%20analysis%20of%20blood%20samples,a%20more%20youthful%20immune%20system)) ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=FMD%20group%20had%20lower%20diabetes,a%20more%20youthful%20immune%20system)). These changes translate to a lower risk for metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.

By returning to a more ancient pattern (plant-heavy diet with periods of fasting), we can in many cases reverse or stave off early metabolic disease. In fact, a recent study (by collaborators of Longo) in type 2 diabetics found that integrating an FMD program in primary care reduced patients’ need for diabetes medications and improved glycemic control over 12 months ([Self-initiated lifestyle changes during a fasting-mimicking diet ...](https://bmcprimcare.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-024-02405-5#:~:text=Self,medication%20and%20improves%20glycaemic)) ([Integration of a fasting-mimicking diet programme in primary care for ...](https://www.scilit.com/publications/daa15e75c68d712d325d896317981b86#:~:text=Integration%20of%20a%20fasting,month)).

- **Cancer:** Longo has been a pioneer in studying fasting as an adjunct to cancer treatment. His early work in cell culture and animals showed that short-term fasting can protect normal cells from chemotherapy’s toxic effects while leaving cancer cells vulnerable – a concept called **differential stress resistance** ([

One mouse study on aggressive cancers found that a 4-day FMD along with chemo **“strips away the guard”** protecting tumors: it boosted levels of immune cells (T cells, NK cells, etc.) that can infiltrate and attack the tumor, and it **expelled immunosuppressive T-regulatory cells** that cancer uses to hide from the immune system ([Fasting-like diet turns the immune system against cancer](https://keck.usc.edu/news/fasting-like-diet-turns-the-immune-system-against-cancer/#:~:text=%23%20A%20low,protect%20against%20chemotherapy%E2%80%99s%20side%20effects)) ([Fasting-like diet turns the immune system against cancer](https://keck.usc.edu/news/fasting-like-diet-turns-the-immune-system-against-cancer/#:~:text=In%20the%20mouse%20study%2C%20scientists,the%20T%20regulatory%20cells%E2%80%99%20mitochondria)).

In essence, fasting flips a switch that makes chemotherapy more effective: for example, three cycles of FMD with chemo in mice doubled the number of bone marrow progenitor cells and led to a 33% increase in cancer-killing white blood cells, significantly slowing tumor progression ([Fasting-like diet turns the immune system against cancer](https://keck.usc.edu/news/fasting-like-diet-turns-the-immune-system-against-cancer/#:~:text=mice%20on%20four%20days%20of,found%20similar%20effects%20on%20melanoma)) ([Fasting-like diet turns the immune system against cancer](https://keck.usc.edu/news/fasting-like-diet-turns-the-immune-system-against-cancer/#:~:text=They%20also%20found%20three%20cycles,attacking%20and%20shrinking%20the%20tumors)).

  Longo has also initiated human trials in oncology. A small pilot study of 18 cancer patients who did 3-day fasting (or fasting-like) diets around the time of chemotherapy showed the approach was **safe and feasible**, and hinted at reduced side effects ([Fasting-like diet turns the immune system against cancer](https://keck.usc.edu/news/fasting-like-diet-turns-the-immune-system-against-cancer/#:~:text=A%20fasting,led%20study%20on%20mice)) ([Fasting-like diet turns the immune system against cancer](https://keck.usc.edu/news/fasting-like-diet-turns-the-immune-system-against-cancer/#:~:text=The%20study%20was%20published%20in,18%20cancer%20patients%20on%20chemotherapy)). Patients who fasted reported feeling better during chemo, with potentially less immunosuppression. Larger trials are ongoing, but already some oncologists working with Longo have begun recommending brief fasting before chemo sessions (typically 48–72 hours of fasting or FMD) to improve tolerance ([Fasting mimicking diet as an adjunct to neoadjuvant chemotherapy ...](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16138-3#:~:text=Fasting%20mimicking%20diet%20as%20an,This)) ([Fasting-like diet turns the immune system against cancer](https://keck.usc.edu/news/fasting-like-diet-turns-the-immune-system-against-cancer/#:~:text=%23%20A%20low,protect%20against%20chemotherapy%E2%80%99s%20side%20effects)). Longo cautions that prolonged fasting beyond a few days should only be done in a clinical setting, but a controlled fasting interval could become a low-cost *“tool to make a wide range of cancer cells more vulnerable… while also making the cancer more sensitive to chemotherapy.”* ([Fasting-like diet turns the immune system against cancer](https://keck.usc.edu/news/fasting-like-diet-turns-the-immune-system-against-cancer/#:~:text=%23%20A%20low,protect%20against%20chemotherapy%E2%80%99s%20side%20effects)) ([Fasting-like diet turns the immune system against cancer](https://keck.usc.edu/news/fasting-like-diet-turns-the-immune-system-against-cancer/#:~:text=%23%20A%20low,protect%20against%20chemotherapy%E2%80%99s%20side%20effects)) Researchers are now investigating fasting + immunotherapy combinations as well, building on Longo’s findings that fasting engages the immune system against cancer.

- **Autoimmune and Inflammatory Diseases:** Fasting-mimicking diets may help “reset” an overactive immune system. In 2016, Longo’s team published a breakthrough study applying the FMD to **multiple sclerosis (MS)**, an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the myelin sheath of nerves. In a mouse model of MS, **three cycles of a 3-day FMD (with 7 days refeeding in between)** led to remarkable results: all mice had reduced disease severity and **20% of the FMD-treated mice achieved a complete, long-lasting recovery** (symptoms fully reversed) ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20part%20of,the%20animals%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20researchers%20wrote)) ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=cycles%2C%20with%20a%20control%20group,the%20animals%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20researchers%20wrote)). The fasting cycle triggered a **“death and rebirth” of immune cells** – during the FMD, the body culled a lot of autoreactive immune cells (driven in part by a surge of corticosteroid hormones during fasting ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=benefits%20beyond%20weight%20loss%2C%20with,%E2%80%9D)) ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=Scientists%20discovered%20that%20the%20diet,in%20the%20journal%C2%A0Cell%20Reports%2C%20included))), and then upon refeeding, new healthy cells were generated from stem cells ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=Scientists%20discovered%20that%20the%20diet,%E2%80%9D)) ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=is%20what%20the%20periodic%2C%20regular,free%20state.%E2%80%9D)). The FMD-fed mice showed higher levels of corticosterone (an anti-inflammatory steroid), reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines, an increase in regulatory T-cells, and crucially, **regeneration of myelin** on nerve fibers ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=Testing%20the%20mice%2C%20the%20researchers,and%20fats%20that%20insulate%20nerve)) ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=immunity,regular%20fasts%20appear%20to%20trigger)). Longo summarized: *“On the one hand, this fasting-mimicking diet kills bad immune cells… Then, after the mice return to the normal diet, the good immune cells and the myelin-producing cells are generated, allowing a percentage of mice to reach a disease-free state.”* ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=is%20what%20the%20periodic%2C%20regular,free%20state.%E2%80%9D)) ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=is%20what%20the%20periodic%2C%20regular,free%20state.%E2%80%9D)) This was a striking demonstration that dietary extremes can provoke the body to repair autoimmune damage, something previously thought achievable only with potent drugs.

  They didn’t stop at mice. The same 2016 study included a *small human trial* in collaboration with doctors in Germany: 60 people with MS were randomized to diets, including a 7-day Fasting-Mimicking Diet followed by Mediterranean diet, versus a keto diet, or normal diet ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=The%20researchers%20also%20checked%20the,improvements%20in%20their%20quality%20of)) ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=with%20the%20disease%2C%20lead%20by,including%20physical%20and%20mental%20health)). The results after 6 months showed that both the FMD+Mediterranean group *and* the ketogenic diet group reported improvements in quality of life and physical and mental health compared to baseline ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=months%2C%2012%20participants%20were%20on,Researchers%20should%20determine)) ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=Those%20who%20received%20a%20fasting,efficacy%20in%20larger%20clinical%20trials)). (The trial wasn’t large enough to see definitive differences between diet groups, and it lacked an MRI analysis, so more research is needed ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=life%20and%20improvements%20in%20health%2C,Longo)) ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=the%20Mediterranean%20diet%20alone%20would,tests%20the%20diet%E2%80%99s%20effect%20on)).) Still, it suggested that even one cycle of fasting, when integrated into a healthy diet, can produce noticeable benefits for autoimmune patients. Longo is cautious but optimistic: given that FMDs have proven safe in various trials, he suggests that patients with autoimmune disorders **“who are out of viable options”** talk to their specialists about trying an FMD under supervision or joining clinical trials in this area ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=Longo%20said%20the%20findings%20beg,diet%E2%80%99s%20effect%20on%20autoimmune%20disorders)) ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=diseases%2C%20and%20they%20should%20test,diet%E2%80%99s%20effect%20on%20autoimmune%20disorders)). He strongly advises against patients attempting longer fasts on their own without medical guidance, especially in serious illnesses ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=Positive%20feedback)) ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=the%20diet,%E2%80%9D)).

- **Cognitive Decline:** There is emerging evidence (mostly in animal models so far) that fasting can protect the brain. In Longo’s 2015 mouse study, periodic FMD in older mice increased neural stem cell number and improved learning and memory tasks, indicating **enhanced cognitive performance** and potential protection against neurodegeneration ([

Additionally, the USC news release noted that FMD reduced *“signs of dementia”* in mouse models ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=Cycles%20of%20a%20diet%20that,led%20study)) ([Fasting-Mimicking Diet Reduces Biological Age | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2024/02/20/fasting-mimicking-diet-biological-age/#:~:text=Previous%20research%20led%20by%20Longo,122%20lowering%20of%20the%20risk)), which likely refers to pathological or behavioral hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. While human evidence is still sparse here, these findings hint that fasting could stimulate brain rejuvenation (possibly via autophagy or promoting neurotrophic factors). Longo often mentions the need to **“keep your brain young”** through diet and lifestyle, and part of that is avoiding insulin resistance (since diabetes is a risk factor for dementia). By improving metabolic health, the diet-fasting regimen may indirectly lower dementia risk. Longo has proposed future trials to see if FMD cycles can benefit people with mild cognitive impairment or prevent Alzheimer’s, but such studies are in early stages.

Overall, **Dr. Longo envisions nutrition and fasting as powerful medicine for chronic disease**. He frequently contrasts the minimal cost and high benefit of dietary change to the expensive drugs or treatments we rely on after disease has taken hold. *“There is nothing that even comes close to the benefit that we will have for almost nothing, free or close to free, by changing food habits. And it could be revolutionary,”* Longo asserts ([Professor Valter Longo: fasting and healthy aging - Center for Lifespan Health](https://lifespanhealth.usc.edu/professor-valter-longo-fasting-and-healthy-aging/#:~:text=The%20enormous%20potential%20of%20food,to%20prevent%20and%20address%20disease)) ([Professor Valter Longo: fasting and healthy aging - Center for Lifespan Health](https://lifespanhealth.usc.edu/professor-valter-longo-fasting-and-healthy-aging/#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)). In his ideal scenario, widespread adoption of longevity diet principles and periodic fasting could **dramatically cut rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cancer** incidence. Even when diseases like cancer occur, fasting could enhance standard treatments, making them more effective and less harmful. It’s important to note that Longo does not position these diets as a **cure-all** – he always acknowledges that some people will still need medical interventions and that diet isn’t a guarantee against disease ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=Other%20than%20genes%2C%20it%20is,need%20for%20drugs%20and%20interventions)) ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=before%2050%20years%20old,need%20for%20drugs%20and%20interventions)). But as a preventive strategy, he believes it’s our best tool. By targeting fundamental aging processes (like high insulin/IGF-1, inflammation, cell senescence, etc.), the diet and fasting interventions attack the *common roots* of multiple diseases of aging, rather than one disease at a time.

## Exercise, Lifestyle, and Mental Well-Being

While diet is the cornerstone, Longo recognizes that a holistic longevity program includes **physical activity** and other lifestyle factors. In his hierarchy, once a healthy diet is in place, the next most important anti-aging factor is **staying active** ([A Lesson From Centenarians: Physical Activity](https://www.drfranklipman.com/post/a-lesson-from-centenarians-exercise#:~:text=cause%20a%20high%20degree%20of,affecting%20lifespan%20is%20physical%20activity)) ([A Lesson From Centenarians: Physical Activity](https://www.drfranklipman.com/post/a-lesson-from-centenarians-exercise#:~:text=age%20fifty,affecting%20lifespan%20is%20physical%20activity)). When studying centenarian communities, Longo observed that virtually all long-lived individuals maintain **high levels of physical activity** into old age. *“In Okinawa, I heard stories of fishermen who never retire, and I watched a woman in her nineties dance with a large bottle on her head… In Calabria, 110-year-old Salvatore Caruso told me how he walked every day to the olive grove… In Loma Linda, [centenarians] are famous for their high levels of exercise, including walking fast and going to the gym,”* Longo recounts from his travels ([A Lesson From Centenarians: Physical Activity](https://www.drfranklipman.com/post/a-lesson-from-centenarians-exercise#:~:text=In%20Okinawa%2C%20I%20heard%20stories,physical%20work%20all%20their%20lives)) ([A Lesson From Centenarians: Physical Activity](https://www.drfranklipman.com/post/a-lesson-from-centenarians-exercise#:~:text=times%20a%20week,every%20year%20they%20leave%20their)). The forms of activity vary (dancing, walking, manual labor, gardening, etc.), but the common thread is **movement as a way of life** rather than structured workouts. These elders weren’t necessarily “gym rats,” but they incorporated movement daily and often had active jobs or hobbies (like shepherding, farming, or folk dancing) that they loved.

From these lessons, Longo stresses that the **best exercise is the one you will actually do consistently and enjoy**. *“What physical activity is best for healthy longevity? The one you enjoy most, but also the one you can easily incorporate into your daily schedule and keep doing up to your hundredth birthday and beyond,”* he writes ([A Lesson From Centenarians: Physical Activity](https://www.drfranklipman.com/post/a-lesson-from-centenarians-exercise#:~:text=What%20physical%20activity%20is%20best,Many%20Okinawans)) ([A Lesson From Centenarians: Physical Activity](https://www.drfranklipman.com/post/a-lesson-from-centenarians-exercise#:~:text=%E2%80%8D)). For some, that might be walking, for others swimming, cycling, or yoga – the key is sustainability and avoiding a sedentary lifestyle. Longo notes that regular exercise complements the longevity diet by improving metabolic regulation, maintaining muscle mass, and supporting cardiovascular health ([A Lesson From Centenarians: Physical Activity](https://www.drfranklipman.com/post/a-lesson-from-centenarians-exercise#:~:text=to%20cultivate%20better%20physical%20and,on%20the%20science%20behind%20aging)) ([A Lesson From Centenarians: Physical Activity](https://www.drfranklipman.com/post/a-lesson-from-centenarians-exercise#:~:text=physical%2C%20mental%2C%20and%20emotional%20well,life%20for%20decades%20to%20come)). It also has mental health benefits: exercise reduces stress and can improve mood and cognitive function, contributing to “mental youth.”

**Mental and Social Health:** Dr. Longo often alludes to the importance of mental well-being, stress management, and social connection, even if these aren’t his primary research areas. In the context of fasting and diets, he observes that mental state matters – people under high chronic stress may have elevated cortisol which can counteract some benefits of calorie restriction ([Episode 43: Fasting Mimicking Diet: Beyond with Dr. Valter Longo](https://www.drkarafitzgerald.com/2018/06/08/fasting-diet-beyond-caloric-dr-valter-longo/#:~:text=Longo%20www,if%20it%27s%20a%20temporary%2C)) ([The Science Behind the Fasting Mimicking Diet: Could It Help You?](https://www.drlamcoaching.com/blog/fasting-mimicking-diet-the-science-behind/#:~:text=The%20Science%20Behind%20the%20Fasting,it%20will%20affect%20your)). He has indicated in interviews that techniques to manage stress (whether through meditation, adequate sleep, or simply the act of eating a healthy diet which can stabilize mood) are valuable. In the communities he visited, **staying socially engaged and having purpose** were notable. The Sardinian shepherds he spoke with had a life of routine and purpose well into old age (tending flocks), the Okinawan elders had strong social circles and family ties, and the Californian Adventists had a faith community and volunteerism.

Longo’s foundation site even made a connection to the **World Happiness Report**, noting that some of the world’s longest-lived countries (e.g., Denmark, which often ranks among the happiest) may benefit from societal happiness and support systems ([“Places of Longevity, Happiness, and... - Prof. Valter Longo | Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profvalterlongo/posts/3346100475716072/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CPlaces%20of%20Longevity%2C%20Happiness%2C%20and,What%20makes%20Danes)) ([“Places of Longevity, Happiness, and... - Prof. Valter Longo | Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profvalterlongo/posts/3346100475716072/#:~:text=Facebook%20www,What%20makes%20Danes)). Although such commentary is peripheral, it underscores that **happiness and longevity go hand in hand**. Longo has said that *physical, mental, and emotional well-being – all are essential for extending life expectancy and enhancing quality of life for decades to come* ([A Lesson From Centenarians: Physical Activity](https://www.drfranklipman.com/post/a-lesson-from-centenarians-exercise#:~:text=match%20at%20L223%20physical%2C%20mental%2C,life%20for%20decades%20to%20come)) ([A Lesson From Centenarians: Physical Activity](https://www.drfranklipman.com/post/a-lesson-from-centenarians-exercise#:~:text=physical%2C%20mental%2C%20and%20emotional%20well,life%20for%20decades%20to%20come)). In practical terms, Longo encourages people to **nurture social connections, engage in enjoyable activities, and avoid chronic stressors** as part of a longevity lifestyle. For example, he mentions that many centenarians have hobbies like playing instruments, dancing, or daily walking routines that are not just exercise but also sources of joy and community interaction ([A Lesson From Centenarians: Physical Activity](https://www.drfranklipman.com/post/a-lesson-from-centenarians-exercise#:~:text=In%20Okinawa%2C%20I%20heard%20stories,physical%20work%20all%20their%20lives)) ([A Lesson From Centenarians: Physical Activity](https://www.drfranklipman.com/post/a-lesson-from-centenarians-exercise#:~:text=times%20a%20week,every%20year%20they%20leave%20their)). 

Importantly, Longo believes in **quality of life** alongside quantity. He isn’t advocating extreme measures that might make one miserable just to gain extra years. On the contrary, his philosophy is that one should *feel better* on the longevity diet – more energy, clearer mind, a sense of balance. If following a longevity regimen causes undue mental stress or social isolation, then it’s not truly a success. That’s why he builds in flexibility (like the occasional glass of wine or piece of chocolate) so people can enjoy normal social meals and celebrations. By practicing moderation rather than fanaticism, individuals can be happy and still reap health benefits. As one of the Longevity Diet book’s tips puts it: *practice gratitude for the nourishment that food provides to your body and mind* – in other words, view healthy eating as a positive, satisfying experience, not a punishment ([30 Best The Longevity Diet Quotes With Image - Bookey](https://www.bookey.app/quote-book/the-longevity-diet#:~:text=30%20Best%20The%20Longevity%20Diet,18%2F30)).

In summary, **Longo’s holistic longevity plan** can be thought of as: **Nutrition first**, then **exercise and an active lifestyle**, all done in a way that supports mental happiness and social well-being. Combined, these create a virtuous cycle – good food and exercise improve mental health; a positive mental state makes it easier to maintain healthy habits. The end goal is not just to add years to life, but life to years.

## Publications, Programs, and Public Outreach

Dr. Longo has disseminated his findings to both the scientific community and the general public through numerous publications and initiatives:

- **Books:** Longo’s bestselling book *“The Longevity Diet”* (2018) outlines his longevity program for lay readers, including meal plans and the science behind them ([[Valter Longo]-The Longevity Diet- Discover The New Science ...](https://www.amazon.com/Longevity-Discover-Activation-Regeneration-Optimize/dp/B07VMFTF63#:~:text=%5BValter%20Longo%5D,Applying%20these%20pillars%20in)) ([[Valter Longo]-The Longevity Diet- Discover The New Science ...](https://www.amazon.com/Longevity-Discover-Activation-Regeneration-Optimize/dp/B07VMFTF63#:~:text=,Applying%20these%20pillars%20in)). The book details the **5 Pillars of Longevity** research that support his recommendations and provides practical tips for implementing the diet and periodic fasting. Notably, Longo donates all author proceeds from his books to charity – *“the proceeds from the sales of the book are entirely donated to nutritional assistance and awareness programs”* of his foundation ([The opportunity for everyone of a long and healthy life - Fondazione Valter Longo](https://www.fondazionevalterlongo.org/en/#:~:text=The%20proceeds%20from%20the%20sales,by%20the%20Valter%20Longo%20Foundation)). He has also authored an Italian-language book on nutrition for children’s health (reflecting his interest in instilling good habits early in life) ([The opportunity for everyone of a long and healthy life - Fondazione Valter Longo](https://www.fondazionevalterlongo.org/en/#:~:text=,37)).

- **Academic Research:** Longo has published over 100 peer-reviewed papers on aging, fasting, and related topics. Some of his landmark scientific publications include: a 2015 *Cell Metabolism* paper demonstrating FMD benefits in mice and humans ([

His scholarly work has been widely cited and has influenced a new field of “geroprotective diets.”

- **The Valter Longo Foundation (Fondazione Valter Longo Onlus):** In 2015, Longo established a non-profit foundation in Italy with the mission to **make longevity accessible to everyone**, particularly those with serious illnesses or limited means ([The opportunity for everyone of a long and healthy life - Fondazione Valter Longo](https://www.fondazionevalterlongo.org/en/#:~:text=Fondazione%20Valter%20Longo)) ([The opportunity for everyone of a long and healthy life - Fondazione Valter Longo](https://www.fondazionevalterlongo.org/en/#:~:text=The%20Valter%20Longo%20Foundation%20promotes,diseases%20related%20to%20advancing%20age)). The foundation provides **free or low-cost nutritional consultations** and longevity diet guidance – as of 2021, they had conducted over 10,000 initial consultations and answered ~27,000 follow-up questions from the public ([The opportunity for everyone of a long and healthy life - Fondazione Valter Longo](https://www.fondazionevalterlongo.org/en/#:~:text=%2B%2010)) ([The opportunity for everyone of a long and healthy life - Fondazione Valter Longo](https://www.fondazionevalterlongo.org/en/#:~:text=Fondazione%20Valter%20Longo)). They also organize educational campaigns and school programs to teach healthy eating to children ([The opportunity for everyone of a long and healthy life - Fondazione Valter Longo](https://www.fondazionevalterlongo.org/en/#:~:text=Fondazione%20Valter%20Longo%20has%20the,following%20initiatives%20underway)) ([The opportunity for everyone of a long and healthy life - Fondazione Valter Longo](https://www.fondazionevalterlongo.org/en/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Programmi%20educazionali)). The foundation’s motto is “the opportunity for everyone of a long and healthy life,” focusing on both **prevention and treatment support** for diseases like cancer, CVD, and diabetes through nutrition ([The opportunity for everyone of a long and healthy life - Fondazione Valter Longo](https://www.fondazionevalterlongo.org/en/#:~:text=Fondazione%20Valter%20Longo)) ([The opportunity for everyone of a long and healthy life - Fondazione Valter Longo](https://www.fondazionevalterlongo.org/en/#:~:text=The%20Valter%20Longo%20Foundation%20promotes,diseases%20related%20to%20advancing%20age)). It is funded in part by donations and by Longo’s personal contributions (e.g. his book royalties and a portion of proceeds from ProLon sales).

- **Create Cures Foundation:** In the United States, Longo founded the **Create Cures Foundation**, a 501(c)(3) charity with a similar purpose of sponsoring research and providing education on integrative treatments for serious diseases ([Philanthropy

The Create Cures Foundation aims to eventually support clinical trials and patient care programs that combine diet with standard treatments, reflecting Longo’s vision of food as a cornerstone of therapy.

- **Clinical Trials and Clinics:** Longo is actively involved in clinical trials around the world to further test the FMD and longevity diet. He announced a **500-person trial in Southern Italy** to study the longevity diet in depth ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=What%E2%80%99s%20next%20for%20the%20longevity,diet)) ([Study: Valter Longo Characterizes Longevity Diet | USC Gerontology](https://gero.usc.edu/2022/04/28/valter-longo-longevity-diet/#:~:text=The%20next%20step%20in%20researching,and%20having%20several%20short%20fasting)). He also collaborates with hospitals (like Charité in Berlin for the MS trial ([Diet that mimics fasting may also reduce multiple sclerosis symptoms](https://keck.usc.edu/news/diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-also-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/#:~:text=The%20researchers%20also%20checked%20the,cycle%20followed%20by%20the%20Mediterranean)), and USC’s Norris Cancer Center for cancer trials ([Fasting-like diet turns the immune system against cancer](https://keck.usc.edu/news/fasting-like-diet-turns-the-immune-system-against-cancer/#:~:text=Both%20studies%20were%20led%20by,School%20of%20Medicine%20of%20USC))) to evaluate these dietary interventions in patient populations. At the USC Longevity Institute, which he directs, researchers are investigating fasting’s effects on everything from chemotherapy tolerance to immune aging. Longo has indicated that if results continue to be positive, **longevity clinics** could be established where patients can undergo supervised fasting-mimicking diet cycles and receive personalized nutrition plans for disease prevention.

- **Media and Interviews:** As part of his public outreach, Dr. Longo frequently appears in media interviews, podcasts, and conferences. He was a guest on popular podcasts like **The Rich Roll Podcast** and **The School of Greatness with Lewis Howes**, discussing the five pillars and how to implement the Longevity Diet ([Dr. Valter Longo: The 5 Pillars To Increase Your Lifespan & Age in ...](https://lewishowes.com/podcast/the-5-pillars-to-increasing-your-lifespan-aging-in-reverse-with-dr-valter-longo/#:~:text=Dr,lifespan%2C%20and%20the%20Longevity%20Diet)) ([Dr. Valter Longo: The 5 Pillars To Increase Your Lifespan & Age in ...](https://lewishowes.com/podcast/the-5-pillars-to-increasing-your-lifespan-aging-in-reverse-with-dr-valter-longo/#:~:text=Dr,lifespan%2C%20and%20the%20Longevity%20Diet)). He has done TEDx talks and Google Talks explaining fasting-mimicking diets. In a CNBC feature, Longo’s work was highlighted as *“a new frontier in longevity science,”* and he shared insights on fasting as a trending health strategy ([Awardee in the News: Valter Longo on fasting diet and longevity on CNBC - American Federation for Aging Research](https://www.afar.org/news/awardee-in-the-news-valter-longo-on-fasting-diet-and-longevity-on-cnbc?token=ZITucLcZA6ADhSwVBG5IfqhnxslZg7Yriagg-biological-sciences-programscientific-awardsscientific-awardsscientific-awardsscientific-awardsscientific-awards#:~:text=The%20article%2C%20%E2%80%9CFasting%3A%20A%20trending,USC%20Davis%20Longevity%20Institute%2C%20noting)) ([Awardee in the News: Valter Longo on fasting diet and longevity on CNBC - American Federation for Aging Research](https://www.afar.org/news/awardee-in-the-news-valter-longo-on-fasting-diet-and-longevity-on-cnbc?token=ZITucLcZA6ADhSwVBG5IfqhnxslZg7Yriagg-biological-sciences-programscientific-awardsscientific-awardsscientific-awardsscientific-awardsscientific-awards#:~:text=Under%20the%20direction%20of%20the,fasting%20diet%20to%20the%20public)). He also engages with the public on social media: his team runs a **Facebook page and Instagram (@prof_valterlongo)** where they post tips (for instance, highlighting that *“after diet, the second major factor affecting lifespan is physical activity”* along with guidelines from his book ([In general, those who reach age one... - Prof. Valter Longo - Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profvalterlongo/posts/in-general-those-who-reach-age-one-hundred-in-good-health-have-stayed-active-or-/1110784720411223/#:~:text=Facebook%20www.facebook.com%20%20,The)) ([Photo by Valter Longo on October 22, 2024. - Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/prof_valterlongo/p/DBbgknGPDcS/#:~:text=Photo%20by%20Valter%20Longo%20on,The%20Longevity%20Diet))). These platforms are used to clarify common questions (e.g. about fasting safety, or protein intake) and to announce new research findings. Longo’s down-to-earth analogies (like comparing fasting to a reset that “takes your cells from the bad, damaged mode to a new one, like a renovated house”) often resonate in these interviews.

- **Recognition:** Beyond the *Time* magazine honor, Longo has received numerous awards in the gerontology field, such as the Vincent Cristofalo “Rising Star” Award from AFAR ([Awardee in the News: Valter Longo on fasting diet and longevity on CNBC - American Federation for Aging Research](https://www.afar.org/news/awardee-in-the-news-valter-longo-on-fasting-diet-and-longevity-on-cnbc?token=ZITucLcZA6ADhSwVBG5IfqhnxslZg7Yriagg-biological-sciences-programscientific-awardsscientific-awardsscientific-awardsscientific-awardsscientific-awards#:~:text=On%20October%2024%2C%202017%2C%20CNBC,PhD%20on%20fasting%20and%20longevity)). *Discover* magazine in 2012 named one of his fasting studies among the top science stories of the year. His research has been covered in major outlets like *The New York Times, The Guardian, BBC, Scientific American,* and more – often with headlines about “Fasting Diet Regenerates Immune System” or “Could Fasting Cure Disease?” This has positioned Longo as a leading public voice on the science of fasting. Importantly, he continuously advocates that any such regimen be **evidence-based**. He has criticized fad diets or extreme claims not backed by solid data, insisting that his recommendations remain tied to what research can support ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=mostly%20plant,the%20populations%20who%20have%20record)) ([USC scientist Valter Longo talks about how to live a longer and healthier life – USC Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://ngp.usc.edu/2018/02/05/usc-scientist-valter-longo-talks-about-how-to-live-a-longer-and-healthier-life/#:~:text=matter%20of%20oversimplification%2C%20in%20which,long%20run%20this%20leads%20to)). 

In conclusion, Dr. Valter Longo’s body of work paints a comprehensive picture of how nutrition and fasting can influence aging and health. He believes that by **adopting a longevity diet, staying physically active, and periodically tricking our bodies into a fasting mode**, we can activate ancient survival pathways that **protect and rejuvenate our cells**, thereby extending healthy life. His message is one of empowerment: aging is no longer seen as an untouchable destiny, but something we can **proactively intervene in** through everyday choices. As he often reminds audiences, the benefits come at little to no cost – it’s about *changing how we eat and live*, a strategy that could potentially save millions of lives from chronic disease. With ongoing research, Longo and colleagues are continuing to refine these recommendations and verify long-term outcomes, but the overarching principles are now well-established. By following Dr. Longo’s longevity guidelines, one might not only **add years to life, but life to years** – staying vital, happy, and healthy well into advanced age, just like the centenarians who inspired this work.
